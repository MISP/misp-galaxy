# misp-galaxy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MISP/misp-galaxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MISP/misp-galaxy)

MISP galaxy is a simple method to express a large object called cluster that can be attached to MISP events or
attributes. A cluster can be composed of one or more elements. Elements are expressed as key-values. There
are default vocabularies available in MISP galaxy but those can be overwritten, replaced or updated as you wish.

Existing clusters and vocabularies can be used as-is or as a template. MISP distribution can be applied
to each cluster to permit a limited or broader distribution scheme.

Vocabularies are from existing standards (like STIX, Veris, MISP and so on) or custom ones.

The objective is to have a comment set of clusters for organizations starting analysis but that can be expanded
to localized information (which is not shared) or additional information (that can be shared).

## MISP Integration

Starting from [MISP 2.4.56](http://www.misp-project.org/2016/12/07/MISP.2.4.56.released.html), galaxy is integrated within the MISP threat sharing platform and users can directly benefit from the available clusters to attach them to the MISP event.
