          "!IMPORTANT ! READ CAREFULLY: Your computer has fallen victim to the Kirk malware and important files have been encrypted - locked up so they don't work. This may have broken some software, including games, office suites etc. Here's a list of some the file extensions that were targetted : *** There are an additional 441 file extensions that are targetted\n. They are mostly to do with games. To get your files back, you need to pay. Now. Payments\nrecieved more than 48 hours after the time of infection will be charged double. Further time penalties are listed below. The time of infection has been logged. Any files with the extensions listed above will now have the extra extension '.kirked\n', these files are encrypted using military grade encryption.In the place you ran this program from, you should find a note (named RANSOM_NOTE.txt) similar to this one.\nYou will also find a file named 'pwd' - this is your encrypted password file. Although it was generated by your computer, you have no way of ever decrypting it. This is due to the security of both the way it was generated and the way it was encrypted. Your files were encrypted using this password. SPOCK TO THE RESCUE!\n\"Logic, motherfucker.\" ~ Spock.\nDecrypting your files is easy. Take a deep breath and follow the steps below.1) Make the proper payment. Payments are made in Monero. This is a crypto-currency, like bitcoin.  You can buy Monero, and send it, from the same places you can any othercrypto-currency. If you're still unsure, google' bitcoin exchange'.  Sign up at one of these exchange sites and send the payment to the address below.  Make note of the payment / transaction ID, or make one up if you have the option. Payment Address (Monero Wallet):   3000375  -199390 0  0 4AqSwfTexbNaHcn8giSJw3KPiWYHGBaCF9bdgPxvHbd5A8Q3Fc7n6FQCReEns8uEg8jUo4BeB79rwf4XSfQPVL1SKdVp2jz Prices:    Days   :Monero: Offer Expires\n    0-2    :  50      : 03/18/17 15:32:14\n    3-7    :  100     : 03/23/17 15:32:14\n    8-14   :  200     : 03/30/17 15:32:14\n    15-30  :  500     : 04/15/17 15:32:14 Note: In 31 days your password decryption key gets permanently deleted. You then have no way to ever retrieve your files. So pay now \n2) Email us Send your pwd file as an email attachment to one of the email addresses below.  Include the payment ID from step 1.  Active email addresses:   kirk.help@scryptmail.com    kirk.payments@scryptmail.com \n3) Decrypt your files. You will recieve your decrypted password file and a program called 'Spock'.  Download these both to the same place and run Spock. Spock reads in your decrypted password file and uses it to decrypt all of the affected files on your computer. &gt; IMPORTANT ! The password is unique to this infection. Using an old password or one from another machine will result in corrupted files.    Corrupted files cannot be retrieved.    Don't fuck around. \n4) Breathe. \nLIVE LONG AND PROSPER",

It will only happen if you don't comply. However I've already encrypted your personal files, so you cannot access therm. Every hour I select some of them to delete permanently, therefore I won't be able to access them, either. Are you familiar with the concept of exponential growth? Let me help you out. It starts out slowly then increases rapidly. During the first 24 hour you will only lose a few files, the second day a few hundred, the third day a few thousand, and so on. If you turn off your computer or try to close me, when i start the next time you will het 1000 files deleted as punishment. Yes you will want me to start next time, since I am the only one that is capable to decrypt your personal data for you. Now, let's start and enjoy our little game together!

There have been several large scale ransomware campaigns over the last several months. This appears to have some similarities to Nyetya in that it is also based on Petya ransomware. Major portions of the code appear to have been rewritten. The distribution does not appear to have the sophistication of the supply chain attacks we have seen recently.",

Once the developers gain access to the hacked computer, the HC7 ransomware is then installed on all accessible computers on the network.\nOriginally released as HC6, victims began posting about it in the BleepingComputer forums towards the end of November.  As this is a Python-to-exe executable, once the script was extracted ID Ransomware creator Michael Gillespie was able determine that it was decryptable and released a decryptor.\nUnfortunately, a few days later, the ransomware developers released a new version called HC7 that was not decryptable. Thi sis because they removed the hard coded encryption key and instead switched to inputting the key as a command line argument when the attackers run the ransomware executable. Thankfully, there may be a way to get around that as well so that victims can recover their keys.",

Today is a different day.\n\nBehind me is an empty house of dreams and in front of me, full of beautiful white roses. To my left is an empty blue pool of red fish and my right, trees full of spring white blooms.\n\n I drink coffee, I'll continue to read a book from William Faulkner.

A decision to freedom and at the worth of unity, intimacy, joy and love and is the decision to release white roses and to give gifts to all peoples of the world.\n\nI do not think about selling white roses again.

No matter where is my garden and where I am from, no matter if you are a housekeeper or a big company owner, it does not matter if you are the west of the world or its east, it's important that the white roses are endless and infinite. You do not need to send letters or e-mails to get these roses. Just wait it tomorrow.

Encryption does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating ciphertext that can be read only if decrypted. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is in principle possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users. in your case “WhiteRose Decryptor” software for safe and complete decryption of all your files and data.\n\nAny other way?\n\nIf you look through this text in the Internet and realise that something is wrong with your files but you do not have any instructions to restore your files, please contact your antivirus support."

Between April 2015 and March 2016, about 56 percent of accounted mobile ransomware was Fusob.\nLike a typical mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort people to pay a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, demanding the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.\nIn order to infect devices, Fusob masquerades as a pornographic video player. Thus, victims, thinking it is harmless, unwittingly download Fusob.\nWhen Fusob is installed, it first checks the language used in the device. If it uses Russian or certain Eastern European languages, Fusob does nothing. Otherwise, it proceeds on to lock the device and demand ransom. Among victims, about 40% of them are in Germany with the United Kingdom and the United States following with 14.5% and 11.4% respectively.\nFusob has lots in common with Small, which is another major family of mobile ransomware. They represented over 93% of mobile ransomwares between 2015 and 2016.",

The attackers will also provide a bitcoin address to the victim that should be used for payment. These bitcoin addresses appear to be unique per victim as the victim's was different from other reported ones.\nAn interesting part of the ransom note is that the attackers state that the ransom price is not negotiable unless the victim's are from Russia. This is common for Russian based attackers, who in many cases tries to avoid infecting Russian victims.\nFinally, could this be a decoy/wiper rather than an actual true ransomware attack? Ransomware attacks typically provide a unique ID to the victim in order to distinguish one victim from another. This prevents a victim from \"stealing\" another victim's payment and using it to unlock their computer.\nIn a situation like this, where no unique ID is given to identify the encrypted computer and the email is publicly accessible, it could be a case where the main goal is to wipe a server or act as a decoy for another attack.",

The change was not only in name but also in the ransomware's modus operandi. According to the researcher, whose discovery was later confirmed by an Intezer code similarity analysis, the new (Satan) DBGer ransomware now also incorporates Mimikatz, an open-source password-dumping utility. The purpose of DBGer incorporating Mimikatz is for lateral movement inside compromised networks. This fits a recently observed trend in Satan's modus operandi.",
