          "!IMPORTANT ! READ CAREFULLY: Your computer has fallen victim to the Kirk malware and important files have been encrypted - locked up so they don't work. This may have broken some software, including games, office suites etc. Here's a list of some the file extensions that were targetted : *** There are an additional 441 file extensions that are targetted\n. They are mostly to do with games. To get your files back, you need to pay. Now. Payments\nrecieved more than 48 hours after the time of infection will be charged double. Further time penalties are listed below. The time of infection has been logged. Any files with the extensions listed above will now have the extra extension '.kirked\n', these files are encrypted using military grade encryption.In the place you ran this program from, you should find a note (named RANSOM_NOTE.txt) similar to this one.\nYou will also find a file named 'pwd' - this is your encrypted password file. Although it was generated by your computer, you have no way of ever decrypting it. This is due to the security of both the way it was generated and the way it was encrypted. Your files were encrypted using this password. SPOCK TO THE RESCUE!\n\"Logic, motherfucker.\" ~ Spock.\nDecrypting your files is easy. Take a deep breath and follow the steps below.1) Make the proper payment. Payments are made in Monero. This is a crypto-currency, like bitcoin.  You can buy Monero, and send it, from the same places you can any othercrypto-currency. If you're still unsure, google' bitcoin exchange'.  Sign up at one of these exchange sites and send the payment to the address below.  Make note of the payment / transaction ID, or make one up if you have the option. Payment Address (Monero Wallet):   3000375  -199390 0  0 4AqSwfTexbNaHcn8giSJw3KPiWYHGBaCF9bdgPxvHbd5A8Q3Fc7n6FQCReEns8uEg8jUo4BeB79rwf4XSfQPVL1SKdVp2jz Prices:    Days   :Monero: Offer Expires\n    0-2    :  50      : 03/18/17 15:32:14\n    3-7    :  100     : 03/23/17 15:32:14\n    8-14   :  200     : 03/30/17 15:32:14\n    15-30  :  500     : 04/15/17 15:32:14 Note: In 31 days your password decryption key gets permanently deleted. You then have no way to ever retrieve your files. So pay now \n2) Email us Send your pwd file as an email attachment to one of the email addresses below.  Include the payment ID from step 1.  Active email addresses:   kirk.help@scryptmail.com    kirk.payments@scryptmail.com \n3) Decrypt your files. You will recieve your decrypted password file and a program called 'Spock'.  Download these both to the same place and run Spock. Spock reads in your decrypted password file and uses it to decrypt all of the affected files on your computer. &gt; IMPORTANT ! The password is unique to this infection. Using an old password or one from another machine will result in corrupted files.    Corrupted files cannot be retrieved.    Don't fuck around. \n4) Breathe. \nLIVE LONG AND PROSPER"

No data was stolen and no one will be able to do it while they are encrypted. For you we have automatic decryptor and instructions for remediation. How to get the automatic decryptor : \n1) Pay 0,25 BTC Buy BTC on one of these sites: https://localbitcoins.com https://www.coinbase.com https://xchange.cc bitcoin adress for pay: 1KG8rWYWRYHfvjVe8ddEyJNCg6HxVWYSQm Send 0,25 BTC \n2) Send screenshot of payment to unCrypte@outlook.com. In the letter include your personal ID (look at the beginning of this document). \n3) You will receive automatic decryptor and all files will be restored \n* To be sure in getting the decryption, you can send one file (less than 10MB) to unCrypte@outlook.com In the letter include your personal ID (look at the beginning of this document). But this action will increase the cost of the automatic decryptor on 0,25 btc... \nAttention! \n• No Payment = No decryption \n• You really get the decryptor after payment \n• Do not attempt to remove the program or run the anti-virus tools \n• Attempts to self-decrypting files will result in the loss of your data \n• Decoders other users are not compatible with your data, because each user's unique encryption key"
