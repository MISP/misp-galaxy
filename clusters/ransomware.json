          "!IMPORTANT ! READ CAREFULLY: Your computer has fallen victim to the Kirk malware and important files have been encrypted - locked up so they don't work. This may have broken some software, including games, office suites etc. Here's a list of some the file extensions that were targetted : *** There are an additional 441 file extensions that are targetted\n. They are mostly to do with games. To get your files back, you need to pay. Now. Payments\nrecieved more than 48 hours after the time of infection will be charged double. Further time penalties are listed below. The time of infection has been logged. Any files with the extensions listed above will now have the extra extension '.kirked\n', these files are encrypted using military grade encryption.In the place you ran this program from, you should find a note (named RANSOM_NOTE.txt) similar to this one.\nYou will also find a file named 'pwd' - this is your encrypted password file. Although it was generated by your computer, you have no way of ever decrypting it. This is due to the security of both the way it was generated and the way it was encrypted. Your files were encrypted using this password. SPOCK TO THE RESCUE!\n\"Logic, motherfucker.\" ~ Spock.\nDecrypting your files is easy. Take a deep breath and follow the steps below.1) Make the proper payment. Payments are made in Monero. This is a crypto-currency, like bitcoin.  You can buy Monero, and send it, from the same places you can any othercrypto-currency. If you're still unsure, google' bitcoin exchange'.  Sign up at one of these exchange sites and send the payment to the address below.  Make note of the payment / transaction ID, or make one up if you have the option.

You then have no way to ever retrieve your files. So pay now \n2) Email us Send your pwd file as an email attachment to one of the email addresses below.  Include the payment ID from step 1.  Active email addresses:   kirk.help@scryptmail.com    kirk.payments@scryptmail.com \n3) Decrypt your files. You will recieve your decrypted password file and a program called 'Spock'.  Download these both to the same place and run Spock. Spock reads in your decrypted password file and uses it to decrypt all of the affected files on your computer. &gt; IMPORTANT ! The password is unique to this infection. Using an old password or one from another machine will result in corrupted files.    Corrupted files cannot be retrieved.

How to get the automatic decryptor : \n1) Pay 0,25 BTC Buy BTC on one of these sites: https://localbitcoins.com https://www.coinbase.com https://xchange.cc bitcoin adress for pay: 1KG8rWYWRYHfvjVe8ddEyJNCg6HxVWYSQm Send 0,25 BTC \n2) Send screenshot of payment to unCrypte@outlook.com. In the letter include your personal ID (look at the beginning of this document). \n3) You will receive automatic decryptor and all files will be restored \n* To be sure in getting the decryption, you can send one file (less than 10MB) to unCrypte@outlook.com In the letter include your personal ID (look at the beginning of this document). But this action will increase the cost of the automatic decryptor on 0,25 btc... \nAttention! \n• No Payment = No decryption \n• You really get the decryptor after payment \n• Do not attempt to remove the program or run the anti-virus tools \n• Attempts to self-decrypting files will result in the loss of your data \n• Decoders other users are not compatible with your data, because each user's unique encryption key"

It will only happen if you don't comply. However I've already encrypted your personal files, so you cannot access therm. Every hour I select some of them to delete permanently, therefore I won't be able to access them, either. Are you familiar with the concept of exponential growth? Let me help you out. It starts out slowly then increases rapidly. During the first 24 hour you will only lose a few files, the second day a few hundred, the third day a few thousand, and so on. If you turn off your computer or try to close me, when i start the next time you will het 1000 files deleted as punishment. Yes you will want me to start next time, since I am the only one that is capable to decrypt your personal data for you. Now, let's start and enjoy our little game together!

As was the case in previous situations, we quickly mobilized to assess the situation and ensure that customers remain protected from this and other threats as they emerge across the threat landscape. There have been several large scale ransomware campaigns over the last several months. This appears to have some similarities to Nyetya in that it is also based on Petya ransomware. Major portions of the code appear to have been rewritten. The distribution does not appear to have the sophistication of the supply chain attacks we have seen recently.",

As this is a Python-to-exe executable, once the script was extracted ID Ransomware creator Michael Gillespie was able determine that it was decryptable and released a decryptor.\nUnfortunately, a few days later, the ransomware developers released a new version called HC7 that was not decryptable.

But not only it. It is required also to have the special decryption software\n(in your case “Black Ruby Decryptor” software) for safe and complete decryption of all your files and data.\n\n[Everything is clear for me but what should I do?]\n\n The first step is reading these instructions to the end. Your files have been encrypted with the “Black Ruby Ransomware” software; the instructions (“HOW-TO-DECRYPT-FILES.txt”) in the folders with your encrypted files are not viruses, they will help you. After reading this text the most part of people start searching in the Internet the words the “Black Ruby Ransomware” where they find a lot of ideas, recommendation and instructions. It is necessary to realise that we are the ones who closed the lock on your files and we are the only ones who have this secret key to open them.\n\n[Have you got advice?]\n\n[*** Any attempts to get back you files with the third-party tools can be fatal for your encrypted files ***]\nThe most part of the tried-party software change data with the encrypted files to restore it but this cases damage to the files. \nFinally it will be impossible to decrypt your files. When you make a puzzle but some items are lost, broken or not put in its place - the puzzle items will never match, the same way the third-party software will ruin your files completely and irreversibly. You should realise that any intervention of the third-party software to restore files encrypted with the “Black Ruby Ransomware” software may be fatal for your files.\n\nIf you look through this text in the Internet and realise that something is wrong with your files but you do not have any instructions to restore your files, please contact your antivirus support."

Today is a different day.\n\nBehind me is an empty house of dreams and in front of me, full of beautiful white roses. To my left is an empty blue pool of red fish and my right, trees full of spring white blooms.\n\n I drink coffee, I'll continue to read a book from William Faulkner. In the garden environment, peace and quiet. My life always goes that way. Always alone without even an intimate friend.\n\nI have neither a pet, nor a friend or an enemy; I am a normal person with fantastic wishes among the hordes of white rose flowers. Everything is natural. I'm just a little interested in hacking and programming. My only electronic devices in this big garden are an old laptop for do projects and an iPhone for check out the news feeds for malware analytics on Twitter without likes posts.\n\nBelieve me, my only assets are the white roses of this garden. I think of days and write at night: the story, poem, code, exploit or the accumulation of the number of white roses sold and I say to myself that the wealth is having different friends of different races, languages, habits and religions, Not only being in a fairly stylish garden with full of original white roses.\n\nToday, I think deeply about the decision that has involved my mind for several weeks. A decision to freedom and at the worth of unity, intimacy, joy and love and is the decision to release white roses and to give gifts to all peoples of the world.\n\nI do not think about selling white roses again. This time, I will plant all the white roses of the garden to bring a different gift for the people of each country. No matter where is my garden and where I am from, no matter if you are a housekeeper or a big company owner, it does not matter if you are the west of the world or its east, it's important that the white roses are endless and infinite. You do not need to send letters or e-mails to get these roses. Just wait it tomorrow. Wait for good days with White Rose.\n\nI hope you accept this gift from me and if it reaches you, close your eyes and place yourself in a large garden on a wooden chair and feel this beautiful scene to reduce your anxiety and everyday tension.\n\nThank you for trusting me.

Encryption does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating ciphertext that can be read only if decrypted. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is in principle possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users. in your case “WhiteRose Decryptor” software for safe and complete decryption of all your files and data.\n\nAny other way?\n\nIf you look through this text in the Internet and realise that something is wrong with your files but you do not have any instructions to restore your files, please contact your antivirus support."

Between April 2015 and March 2016, about 56 percent of accounted mobile ransomware was Fusob.\nLike a typical mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort people to pay a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, demanding the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.\nIn order to infect devices, Fusob masquerades as a pornographic video player. Thus, victims, thinking it is harmless, unwittingly download Fusob.\nWhen Fusob is installed, it first checks the language used in the device. If it uses Russian or certain Eastern European languages, Fusob does nothing. Otherwise, it proceeds on to lock the device and demand ransom. Among victims, about 40% of them are in Germany with the United Kingdom and the United States following with 14.5% and 11.4% respectively.\nFusob has lots in common with Small, which is another major family of mobile ransomware. They represented over 93% of mobile ransomwares between 2015 and 2016.",

The NMCRYPT Ransomware is a file encoder Trojan that is designed to make data unreadable and convince users to pay a fee for unlocking content on the infected computers. The NMCRYPT Ransomware is nearly identical to hundreds of variants of the HiddenTear open-source ransomware and compromised users are unable to use the Shadow Volume snapshots made by Windows to recover. Unfortunately, the NMCRYPT Ransomware disables the native recovery features on Windows, and you need third-party applications to rebuild your data.",

This prevents a victim from \"stealing\" another victim's payment and using it to unlock their computer.\nIn a situation like this, where no unique ID is given to identify the encrypted computer and the email is publicly accessible, it could be a case where the main goal is to wipe a server or act as a decoy for another attack.",

According to the researcher, whose discovery was later confirmed by an Intezer code similarity analysis, the new (Satan) DBGer ransomware now also incorporates Mimikatz, an open-source password-dumping utility. The purpose of DBGer incorporating Mimikatz is for lateral movement inside compromised networks. This fits a recently observed trend in Satan's modus operandi.",

For this, I want 25 000 sek, I want\nthem in bitcoin. Email me when you've paid with details about the transaction. I'll give you two days.\nIf you have not paid in two days(from the day you received the email), It will cost 1000 sek more per day.\n  If I have not heard from you after five days (from the day you received the email), I assume your files are not that\nimportant to you. So I'll delete your decryption-key, and you will never see your files again.\n\n\nAfter the payment, email me the following information:\n* the bitcoin address you sent from (important, write it down when you do the transaction)\n* the ID at the bottom of this document (this is important!! Otherwise I don't know which key belongs\nto you).\nThen I will send you the decryption-program and provide you with instructions of how to remove\nthe virus if you have not already figured it out.\n\n\nEmail:\naperfectday2018@protonmail.com\n\nBitcoin adress:  \n1LX3tBkW161hoF5DbGzbrm3sdXaF6XHv2D\n\nMake sure to get the bitcoin adress right, copy and paste and double check. If you send the bitcoin\nto the wrong adress, it will be lost forever. You cant stop or regret a bitcoin transaction.\n\n\nIMPORTANT:  \n\nDo not loose this document. You also have a copy of it on your desktop.\nDo NOT change any filenames!!! !!!\n\n\nThank you for the money, it means a lot to me.  \n\n\n\nID: [redacted 13 numbers]"

The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by INDRIK SPIDER, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.",

On August 1, we found Rig’s traffic stream dropping a then-unknown ransomware. Delving into this seemingly new ransomware, we checked its ransom payment page in the Tor network and saw it was called Princess Evolution (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_PRINCESSLOCKER.B), and was actually a new version of the Princess Locker ransomware that emerged in 2016. Based on its recent advertisement in underground forums, it appears that its operators are peddling Princess Evolution as a ransomware as a service (RaaS) and are looking for affiliates.\nThe new malvertising campaign we observed since July 25 is notable in that the malvertisements included Coinhive (COINMINER_MALXMR.TIDBF). Even if users aren’t diverted to the exploit kit and infected with the ransomware, the cybercriminals can still earn illicit profit through cryptocurrency mining. Another characteristic of this new campaign is that they hosted their malvertisement page on a free web hosting service and used domain name system canonical name (DNS CNAME) to map their advertisement domain on a malicious webpage on the service.",

Oracle first patched the issue on April 26, outside of their normal patch cycle, and assigned it CVE-2019-2725. This vulnerability is easy for attackers to exploit, as anyone with HTTP access to the WebLogic server could carry out an attack. Because of this, the bug has a CVSS score of 9.8/10. Attackers have been making use of this exploit in the wild since at least April 17.

      "description": "Nodera is a ransomware family that uses the Node.js framework and was discovered by Quick Heal researchers. The infection chain starts with a VBS script embedded with multiple JavaScript files. Upon execution, a directory is created and both the main node.exe program and several required NodeJS files are downloaded into the directory. Additionally, a malicious JavaScript payload that performs the encryption process is saved in this directory. After checking that it has admin privileges and setting applicable variables, the malicious JavaScript file enumerates the drives to create a list of targets. Processes associated with common user file types are stopped and volume shadow copies are deleted. Finally, all user-specific files on the C: drive and all files on other drives are encrypted and are appended with a .encrypted extension. The ransom note containing instructions on paying the Bitcoin ransom are provided along with a batch script to be used for decryption after obtaining the private key. Some mistakes in the ransom note identified by the researchers include the fact that it mentions a 2048-bit RSA public key instead of 4096-bit (the size that was actually used), a hard-coded private key destruction time dating back almost 2 years ago, and a lack of instructions for how the private key will be obtained after the ransom is paid. These are signs that the ransomware may be in the development phase and was likely written by an amateur. For more information, see the QuickHeal blog post in the Reference section below.",

      "description": "Bart ransomware is distributed by the same Russian Cyber Mafia behind Dridex 220 and Locky.  Bart doesn't communicate with a command and control (C&C) server, so it can encrypt files without being connected to a computer.\nBart is spread to end users via phishing emails containing .zip attachments with JavaScript Code and use social engineering to trick users into opening the 'photo' attachments. The zipped files are obfuscated to make it more hard to tell what actions they are performing. See screenshot above for an example of what they look like. If opened, these attachments download and install the intermediary loader RockLoader which downloads Bart onto the machine over HTTPS.\nOnce executed, it will first check the language on the infected computer. If the malware detects Russian, Belorussian, or Ukrainian, the ransomware will terminate and will not proceed with the infection. If it's any other language, it will start scanning the computer for certain file extensions to encrypt.\nBecause Bart does not require communication with C&C infrastructure prior to encrypting files, Bart could possibly encrypt machines sitting behind corporate firewalls that would otherwise block such traffic. Thus, organizations need to ensure that Bart is blocked at the email gateway using rules that block zipped executables.",

      "description": "Razor was discovered by dnwls0719, it is a part of Garrantydecrypt ransomware family. Like many other programs of this type, Razor is designed to encrypt files (make them unusable/inaccessible), change their filenames, create a ransom note and change victim's desktop wallpaper. Razor renames files by appending the \".razor\" extension to their filenames. For example, it renames \"1.jpg\" to \"1.jpg.razor\", and so on. It creates a ransom note which is a text file named \"#RECOVERY#.txt\", this file contains instructions on how to contact Razor's developers (cyber criminals) and other details.\nAs stated in the \"#RECOVERY#.txt\" file, this ransomware encrypts all files and information about how to purchase a decryption tool can be received by contacting Razor's developers. Victims supposed to contact them via razor2020@protonmail.ch, Jabber client (razor2020@jxmpp.jp) or ICQ client (@razor2020) and wait for further instructions. It is very likely that they will name a price of a decryption tool and/or key and provide cryptocurrency wallet's address that should be used to make a transaction. However, it is never a good idea to trust (pay) any cyber criminals/ransomware developers. It is common that they do not provide decryption tools even after a payment. Another problem is that ransomware-type programs encrypt files with strong encryption algorithms and their developers are the only ones who have tools that can decrypt files encrypted by their ransomware. In most cases victims have the only free and safe option: to restore files from a backup. Also, it is worth mentioning that files remain encrypted even after uninstallation of ransomware, its removal only prevents it from causing further encryptions.",

Overall, it’s a pretty standard ransomware that utilizes some of the new techniques we see such as multi-threading encryption as well as abusing the Windows Restart Manager similar to Conti and REvil.  For encrypting scheme, Babuk uses its own implementation of SHA256 hashing, ChaCha8 encryption, and Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key generation and exchange algorithm to protect its keys and encrypt files. Like many ransomware that came before, it also has the ability to spread its encryption through enumerating the available network resources.",

This malware is notorious for attacking large organizations and was most active earlier this year.\nRansomEXX is a highly targeted Trojan.

      "description": "Observed as recently as May 2022, MedusaLocker actors predominantly rely on vulnerabilities in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access victims’ networks. The MedusaLocker actors encrypt the victim's data and leave a ransom note with communication instructions in every folder containing an encrypted file. The note directs victims to provide ransomware payments to a specific Bitcoin wallet address. MedusaLocker appears to operate as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model based on the observed split of ransom payments. Typical RaaS models involve the ransomware developer and various affiliates that deploy the ransomware on victim systems. MedusaLocker ransomware payments appear to be consistently split between the affiliate, who receives 55 to 60 percent of the ransom; and the developer, who receives the remainder.",

      "description": "PwndLocker is a ransomware that was observed in late 2019 and is reported to have been used to target businesses and local governments/cities. According to one source, ransom amounts demanded as part of PwndLocker activity range from $175k USD to $650k USD depending on the size of the network. PwndLocker attempts to disable a variety of Windows services so that their data can be encrypted. Various processes will also be targeted, such as web browsers and software related to security, backups, and databases. Shadow copies are cleared by the ransomware, and encryption of files occurs once the system has been prepared in this way. Executable files and those that are likely to be important for the system to continue to function appear to be skipped by the ransomware, and a large number of folders mostly related to Microsoft Windows system files are also ignored. As of March 2020, encrypted files have been observed with the added extensions of .key and .pwnd. Ransom notes are dropped in folders where encrypted files are found and also on the user's desktop.",

Their reputation has allowed the group to create a strong brand name, attracting many affiliates which has made Conti one of the most widespread ransomware strains in the world.\nOne of the last known “Conti” attacks was against the government of Costa Rica in April 2022 causing the country to declare a state of emergency.\nShortly after this final attack, the “Conti” brand disappeared. The group behind it likely switched to a different brand to avoid sanctions and start over with a new, clean reputation.",

BlackCat has many advanced capabilities like escalating privileges and bypassing UAC make use of AES and ChaCha20 or Salsa encryption, may use the Restart Manager, can delete volume shadow copies, can enumerate disk volumes and network shares automatically, and may kill specific processes and services. The ransomware exists for both Windows, Linux, and ESXi systems. Multiple extortion techniques are used by the BlackCat gang, such as exfiltrating victim data before the ransomware deployment, threats to release data if the ransomw is not paid, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.",

      "description": "BlackByte is recently discovered Ransomware with a .NET DLL core payload wrapped in JavaScript. It employs heavy obfuscation both in its JavaScript wrapper and .NET DLL core.\n\nOnce the JavaScript wrapper is executed, the malware will de-obfuscate the core payload and execute it in memory. The core .DLL is loaded and BlackByte will check the installed operating system language and terminate if an eastern European language is found.\n\nIt will proceed to check for the presence of several anti-virus and sandbox-related .DLLs, attempt to bypass AMSI, delete system shadow-copies in order to hinder system recovery, and modify several other system services (including Windows Firewall) in order to “prep” the system for encryption. Once the system is “ready” for encryption, it will download a symmetric key-file which will be used to encrypt files on the system. If this file is not found, the malware will terminate.\n\nUnlike most Ransomware today, BlackByte uses a single symmetric encryption key, and does not generate a unique encryption key for each victim system, meaning the same key can be used to decrypt all files encrypted by the malware.\n\nThis makes for substantially easier key-management for the actors behind BlackByte at the cost of a weaker encryption scheme and easier victim system recovery (as there is only a single online point with a single key to maintain).\n\nAs with most Ransomware today, BlackByte has worming capabilities and can infect additional endpoints on the same network.",

      "description": "In March 2022, the FBI and the U.S. Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network released a joint advisory addressing AvosLocker and their activity targeting organizations across several critical infrastructure sectors. The RaaS gang deploys ransomware onto their victim’s networks and systems, then threatens to leak their files on the dark web if they don’t pay up. AvosLocker is both the name of the RaaS gang, as well as the name of the ransomware itself.\n\nIn May 2022, AvosLocker took responsibility for attacking and stealing data from the Texas-based healthcare organization, CHRISTUS Health. CHRISTUS Health runs hundreds of healthcare facilities across Mexico, the U.S., and South America. The group stole information from a cancer patient registry which included names, social security numbers, diagnoses, dates of birth, and other medical information. The nonprofit Catholic health system has more than 600 healthcare facilities in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, and Arkansas. There are also facilities in Columbia, Mexico, and Chile.\n\nFortunately, the ransomware attack was quickly identified and was limited. While other healthcare organizations have not been as fortunate with ransomware attacks, the AvosLocker attack didn’t impact CHRISTUS Health’s patient care or clinical operations. CHRISTUS Health didn’t reveal whether or not the security incident included ransomware, data exfiltration or extortion, but due to AvosLocker’s reputation, it is more than likely that the incident included at least one of the three.",

      "description": "BianLian used subtle techniques to exploit, enumerate, and move laterally in victim networks to remain undetected and aggressively worked to counter Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) protections during the encryption phase of their operations. The group has displayed signs of being new to the practical business aspects of ransomware and associated logistics. Generally they seemed to be experiencing the growing pains of a group of talented hackers new to this aspect of criminal extortion.\n\nInfrastructure associated with the BianLian group first appeared online in December 2021 and their toolset appears to have been under active development since then. Finally, we have observed the BianLian threat actor tripling their known command and control (C2) infrastructure in the month of August, suggesting a possible increase in the actor’s operational tempo.",

Risen is written in C language and completely using winapi. We produced many products with different features and options, but we came to the conclusion that none of the options have the benefit and efficiency they should; So, instead of spending time on useless and inefficient options, we decided to spend all our time on the strength, speed and security of our cryptography, and that's how we created Risen. Software features in version 1:    \r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>    -Encryption security, utilizing Chacha20 and RSA 2048 algorithms.\r<br/>    -High encryption speed and software optimization\r<br/>    -compatible with all versions of Windows on any hardware without any issues.\r<br/>    -Automatic option settings, its easy to using and default configuration set to the best mode.\r<br/>    -Utilization of Threadpool method and queue creation for encryption.\r<br/>    -A powerful file unlocker, unlock files without closing processes.\r<br/>    -Safe deletion of backups, shadow copies, and all windows logs.\r<br/>    -A blog, Leak website, and management panel on TOR for leaking data of non-paying companies.\r<br/>",
