As early as January, one set of actors exploited CVE-2022-47966, a vulnerability in the Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus IT service management application that allows remote code execution, to access the organization’s public-facing web servers. A separate set of actors was also observed exploiting CVE-2022-42475, a vulnerability in Fortinet, Inc.’s FortiOS SSL-VPN that also allows remote code execution, to gain access to the organization’s firewall devices.\n\nAfter gaining access, the actors downloaded malware, performed network discovery, collected administrator credentials, and moved laterally, but according to the advisory, unclear data storage records inhibited insight into whether any proprietary information was accessed, altered, or exfiltrated.

The actors used a legitimate vulnerability scanner, Acunetix, to scan state election websites, and they attempted to exploit sites with directory traversal, SQL injection, and web shell upload attacks. Authorities confirmed the actors successfully obtained voter registration data in at least one state – after abusing a website misconfiguration, they used a cURL-based scripting tool to iterate through and retrieve voter records. Officials assessed that the actor behind the website attacks is responsible for mass dissemination of intimidation emails to U.S. citizens and a disinformation campaign featuring a U.S. election-related propaganda video in mid-October 2020. Authorities furthermore assessed that information obtained during the website attacks was featured in the propaganda video.<sup>[[U.S. CISA Iran Voter Data November 3 2020](/references/be89be75-c33f-4c58-8bf0-979c1debaad7)]</sup>",

The advisory updated a previous alert (AA21-321A), published in November 2021, and summarized recent activities linked to the actors. Since at least March 2021, the actors were observed targeting victims in a wide range of U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including transportation and healthcare, and victims in unspecified sectors in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe actors typically exploited vulnerabilities to gain initial network access. They were observed exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers (ProxyShell) and Fortinet devices in 2021, and VMware Horizon (Log4j) in 2022. After gaining access, the actors typically evaluated the perceived value of data held within a victim network and either encrypted it for ransom and/or exfiltrated it. The actors are believed to have sold some exfiltrated data or used it as leverage to further pressure victims into paying a ransom.\n\nIn addition to behavioral observations and indicators of compromise, the advisories provided detection and mitigation guidance, which can be found in the source reports [here](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-257a) and [here](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-321a).\n\n**Related Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105<sup>[[U.S. CISA IRGC Actors September 14 2022](/references/728b20b0-f702-4dbe-afea-50270648a3a2)]</sup>, CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591<sup>[[U.S. CISA Iranian Government Actors November 19 2021](/references/d7014279-bc6a-43d4-953a-a6bc1d97a13b)]</sup>",

      "description": "In May 2023, U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) authorities released Cybersecurity Advisory AA23-131A, which detailed observed exploits of a vulnerability, CVE-2023-27350, affecting certain versions of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF, software applications for print management. PaperCut released a patch for the vulnerability in March 2023.<sup>[[PaperCut MF/NG vulnerability bulletin](/references/d6e71b45-fc91-40f4-8201-2186994ae42a)]</sup> According to the Advisory, authorities observed unspecified threat actors exploiting the vulnerability in mid-April 2023, followed by exploitation by the self-identified Bl00dy Ransomware Gang the following month.<sup>[[U.S. CISA PaperCut May 2023](/references/b5ef2b97-7cc7-470b-ae97-a45dc4af32a6)]</sup>\n\nCVE-2023-27350 allows a remote actor to bypass authentication and remotely execute code on servers running affected versions of PaperCut software. In May, U.S. authorities observed Bl00dy Ransomware Gang actors exploiting the vulnerability to achieve initial access into education sector entities' networks and ingressing both legitimate remote management and maintenance (RMM) tools and several other command and control-related malware, including Lizar, Truebot, and Cobalt Strike. In some cases, the actors ultimately exfiltrated victim data and encrypted files, demanding payment in order to decrypt affected systems (the Advisory did not indicate how precisely actors encrypted data). The Advisory indicated that the \"Education Facilities Subsector\" maintains nearly 70% of exposed (but not necessarily vulnerable) U.S.-based PaperCut servers.<sup>[[U.S. CISA PaperCut May 2023](/references/b5ef2b97-7cc7-470b-ae97-a45dc4af32a6)]</sup>\n\nThe Advisory instructed defenders to focus CVE-2023-27350 detection efforts on three areas: network traffic signatures, system monitoring, and server settings and log files.
