Authorities assessed that Truebot infections are primarily motivated around collection and exfiltration of sensitive victim data for financial gain. Officials also assessed that actors were using both spearphishing emails containing malicious hyperlinks and exploitation of CVE-2022-31199 in the IT system auditing application Netwrix Auditor to deliver Truebot during these attacks. Additional tools associated with the attacks included Raspberry Robin for initial infections, FlawedGrace and Cobalt Strike for various post-exploitation activities, and Teleport, a custom tool for data exfiltration.<sup>[[U.S. CISA Increased Truebot Activity July 6 2023](/references/6f9b8f72-c55f-4268-903e-1f8a82efa5bb)]</sup>\n\nThe Advisory did not provide specific impacted victim sectors.

According to the Advisory, authorities observed unspecified advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploiting CVE-2023-35078 as a zero-day from at least April 2023 in order to gather information from unspecified organizations in Norway, and to gain initial access to a Norwegian government agency.\n\nIvanti released a CVE-2023-35078 patch on July 23, but then determined that CVE-2023-35081 could be chained together with the first vulnerability, a process which can enable arbitrary upload and execution of actor files, such as web shells. Ivanti released a CVE-2023-35081 patch on July 28.

As early as January, one set of actors exploited CVE-2022-47966, a vulnerability in the Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus IT service management application that allows remote code execution, to access the organization’s public-facing web servers. A separate set of actors was also observed exploiting CVE-2022-42475, a vulnerability in Fortinet, Inc.’s FortiOS SSL-VPN that also allows remote code execution, to gain access to the organization’s firewall devices.\n\nAfter gaining access, the actors downloaded malware, performed network discovery, collected administrator credentials, and moved laterally, but according to the advisory, unclear data storage records inhibited insight into whether any proprietary information was accessed, altered, or exfiltrated. A common behavior among both sets of actors was log deletion from critical servers and the use of disabled, legitimate administrator credentials, which in one case belonged to a previously employed contractor (the organization confirmed the credentials were disabled before the observed threat activity).<sup>[[U.S. CISA Zoho Exploits September 7 2023](/references/6bb581e8-ed0e-41fe-bf95-49b5d11b4e6b)]</sup>\n\nIn addition to behavioral observations and indicators of compromise, the Advisory provided detection and mitigation guidance, which can be found in the [source report](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-250a).\n\n**Related Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2022-47966, CVE-2022-42475, CVE-2021-44228<sup>[[U.S. CISA Zoho Exploits September 7 2023](/references/6bb581e8-ed0e-41fe-bf95-49b5d11b4e6b)]</sup>",

      "description": "In July 2024, U.S. cybersecurity authorities and international partners published Cybersecurity Advisory AA24-207A, which detailed North Korean state-sponsored cyber espionage activity likely intended to support the regime's military and nuclear development programs. The advisory focused on an actor group tracked as Andariel, Onyx Sleet, and APT45 and highlighted how this group has shifted from conducting destructive attacks to carrying out espionage operations that have been funded through ransomware. Where past destructive operations mainly targeted U.S. and South Korean entities, recent espionage attacks targeted various defense, aerospace, nuclear, and engineering organizations, while ransomware attacks targeted U.S. healthcare entities.\n\nAndariel actors gain initial access especially by exploiting software vulnerabilities, use widely available tools for discovery and privilege escalation, and leverage a wide range of custom as well as commodity malware. The advisory does not clearly identify the timeframe in which malicious activities were observed, although it discusses actors' exploits of vulnerabilities disclosed in 2017, 2019, and especially 2021, 2022, and 2023 and referenced public threat reporting published from March 2021 through May 2024.<sup>[[U.S. CISA Andariel July 25 2024](/references/b615953e-3c6c-4201-914c-4b75e45bb9ed)]</sup>",

Actors collected device information and conducted further network reconnaissance on victims “worldwide”, including U.S. government institutions, 250 Ukrainian entities, and “a small number” of victims elsewhere in Europe. Adversary activity occurred over an unspecified timeframe in 2021.\n\nActors exploited CVE-2017-6742, a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) vulnerability for which Cisco released a patch in 2017, and used default authentication strings to gain initial access to devices and subsequently gather router information, such as router interface details. In some cases, authorities observed actors deploying Jaguar Tooth, a malicious software bundle consisting of a series of payloads and patches.

According to the advisory, these actors are also known as APT29, the Dukes, CozyBear, and NOBELIUM/Midnight Blizzard.\n\nCVE-2023-42793 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the JetBrains TeamCity software development program. After exploiting the vulnerability to gain access into victim networks, SVR actors were then observed escalating privileges, moving laterally, and deploying additional backdoors in an apparent effort to maintain long-term persistent access to victim environments. The advisory noted how SVR actors used access gained during the 2020 compromise of SolarWinds, another software company, to conduct supply chain operations affecting SolarWinds customers, but it also noted that such activity has not been observed in this case to date.\n\nJetBrains released a patch for CVE-2023-42793 in September 2023. The advisory indicated that the compromises observed to date appear to be opportunistic, impacting unpatched, internet-accessible TeamCity servers. “A few dozen” compromised entities have been identified so far (companies in disparate sectors in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia), but authorities assess that this tally does not represent the full number of compromised victims.

Based on infrastructural and behavioral overlaps with other incidents, officials attributed the intrusion to the FIN12 financially motivated actor group and indicated the same actors are responsible for dozens of attacks on French victims in recent years.\n\nAdditional details, indicators of compromise, and the observed Cobalt Strike configuration can be found in the [source report](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2023-CTI-007.pdf).<sup>[[CERTFR-2023-CTI-007](/references/0f4a03c5-79b3-418e-a77d-305d5a32caca)]</sup>\n\n**Related Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2023-21746, CVE-2022-24521, CVE-2021-34527, CVE-2019-0708, CVE-2020-1472<sup>[[CERTFR-2023-CTI-007](/references/0f4a03c5-79b3-418e-a77d-305d5a32caca)]</sup>",

The advisory updated a previous alert (AA21-321A), published in November 2021, and summarized recent activities linked to the actors. Since at least March 2021, the actors were observed targeting victims in a wide range of U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including transportation and healthcare, and victims in unspecified sectors in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe actors typically exploited vulnerabilities to gain initial network access. They were observed exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers (ProxyShell) and Fortinet devices in 2021, and VMware Horizon (Log4j) in 2022. After gaining access, the actors typically evaluated the perceived value of data held within a victim network and either encrypted it for ransom and/or exfiltrated it. The actors are believed to have sold some exfiltrated data or used it as leverage to further pressure victims into paying a ransom.\n\nIn addition to behavioral observations and indicators of compromise, the advisories provided detection and mitigation guidance, which can be found in the source reports [here](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-257a) and [here](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-321a).\n\n**Related Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105<sup>[[U.S. CISA IRGC Actors September 14 2022](/references/728b20b0-f702-4dbe-afea-50270648a3a2)]</sup>, CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591<sup>[[U.S. CISA Iranian Government Actors November 19 2021](/references/d7014279-bc6a-43d4-953a-a6bc1d97a13b)]</sup>",

In some cases, the actors ultimately exfiltrated victim data and encrypted files, demanding payment in order to decrypt affected systems (the Advisory did not indicate how precisely actors encrypted data). The Advisory indicated that the \"Education Facilities Subsector\" maintains nearly 70% of exposed (but not necessarily vulnerable) U.S.-based PaperCut servers.<sup>[[U.S. CISA PaperCut May 2023](/references/b5ef2b97-7cc7-470b-ae97-a45dc4af32a6)]</sup>\n\nThe Advisory instructed defenders to focus CVE-2023-27350 detection efforts on three areas: network traffic signatures, system monitoring, and server settings and log files.

      "description": "Researchers observed a campaign, with activity occurring between March and at least June 2024, where multiple discrete threat actor clusters used similar social engineering techniques to trick users into copying and executing PowerShell scripts, which ultimately led to malware deployment on the victim's system. Payloads included droppers, RATs, and information stealer malware.\n\nInitial contact with the victim occurred through both malspam email campaigns and web browser injects, which would trigger a popup claiming an error occurred when trying to open a document or webpage. The popup would prompt the user to run a script in the PowerShell terminal or Windows Run dialog box. Researchers attributed these campaigns to TA571, an initial access broker, a known intrusion set (ClearFake), and a newer group dubbed ClickFix.<sup>[[Proofpoint June 17 2024](/references/a65d7492-04a4-46d4-85ed-134786c6828b)]</sup><sup>[[BleepingComputer Fake Chrome Errors June 17 2024](/references/6efa70e3-d8eb-4260-b0ab-62335681e6fd)]</sup>",
