Technical knowledge of how machine learning is used can be leveraged by adversaries to perform targeting and tailor attacks to the target system. Additionally, consider limiting the release of organizational information - including physical locations, researcher names, and department structures - from which technical details such as machine learning techniques, model architectures, or datasets may be inferred.\n",
