        "Core Content Note": "Mining and quarrying include the extraction of minerals occurring naturally as solids (coal and ores), liquids (petroleum) or gases (natural gas). Extraction can be achieved by different methods, e.g. underground or surface mining, well operation, seabed mining. This section includes supplementary activities aimed at preparing the crude materials for marketing, for example, crushing, grinding, cleaning, drying, sorting, concentrating ores and liquefaction of natural gas. Mining activities are classified into divisions, groups and classes on the basis of the principal mineral produced. Divisions 05, 06 are concerned with mining and quarrying of fossil fuels (coal, lignite, petroleum, gas); divisions 07, 08 concern metal ores, various minerals and quarry products. Some of the technical operations of this section, particularly related to the extraction of hydrocarbons, may also be carried out for third parties by specialised units as an industrial service, which is reflected in division 09.",
        "Exclusion Note": "This section excludes: - further processing of the extracted materials, see section C - usage of the extracted materials without a further transformation for construction purposes, see section F - bottling of natural spring and mineral waters at springs and wells, see 11.07 - remediation of mine sites, see 39.00",

        "Alternative Label": "MANUFACTURINGThis section includes the physical, mechanical, chemical or biological transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for defining manufacturing (see remark on processing of waste below). The materials, substances, or components undergoing transformation are either raw materials or products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing. The output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilisation or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products. Manufacture of specialised components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialised components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included. Making specialised components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is usually included in group 22.2. Assembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This includes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased components. The recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary raw materials* is classified in group 38.2. While this may involve physical, mechanical, biological or chemical transformations, this is not considered to be a part of manufacturing activities. The primary purpose of these activities is considered to be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in section E. However, the manufacture of new products from secondary raw materials is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process. NOTE: *Secondary raw materials are materials and products which can be used as raw materials by simple re-use, or via recycling and recovery. Specialised maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division 33. However, the repair and maintenance of computers and personal and household goods, and motor vehicles and motorcycles is classified in division 95. The installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialised activity, is classified in class 33.20. Maintenance, repair and installation of equipment that forms an integral part of buildings or similar structures, e.g. maintenance, repair and installation of escalators or of air-conditioning systems, is classified as construction in section F, if carried out at the construction site. This section contains also the activities of Factoryless Goods Producers (FGPs) in manufacturing (see introductory guidelines, paragraph xx). As a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new, rebuilt and remanufactured products. Their output is a new product. As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NACE: - fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat, see 10.20 - milk pasteurising and bottling, see 10.51 - leather converting, see 15.11 - wood preserving, see 16.12 - printing and related activities, excluding published goods, see 18.1 - tyre retreading, see 22.11 - ready-mixed concrete production, see 23.63 - galvanising, electroplating, plating, etc. and other metallic or non-metallic coating of metals, see 25.51 - heat treatment of metals, see 25.52 - refilling of ink cartridges, see 26.20 - refilling or recharging of fire extinguishers, see 28.29 - rebuilding or remanufacture of machinery, e.g. automobile engines, see 29.10 - assembly provided by a seller or blending of several products to be sold. If assembly is provided by a contractor, this activity should be classified in manufacturing. Conversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are classified in other sections of NACE; in other words, they are not considered as manufacturing. They include: - logging, classified in section A - beneficiating of agricultural products, classified in section A - preparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises, classified in division 56 - beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in section B - production of gaseous fuels for energy supply through a permanent network, classified in section D - production of compost from organic waste, classified in section E - assembly provided as part of a delivery or by a seller. However, if assembly is the main activity provided by a contractor, it is classified in manufacturing. - activities of breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, e.g. as liquors or chemicals; sorting and reselling of scrap; mixing paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order; treatment not resulting into a different good, classified in section G - publishing and the combined activities of publishing and printing are classified in section J",

Transit trade represents a triangular transaction in which the transit trader carries out export and import transactions between two or more different countries outside his own economic territory. The transit trader owns the commodity during its transport (difference to intermediaries that do not take ownership of the intermediated goods) - specialised and non-specialised intermediation service activities for retail sale, see 47.9 - sale of food or and beverages via vending machines or automated points of sale",
        "Alternative Label": "WHOLESALE AND RETAIL TRADE",
        "Core Content Note": "This section includes wholesale and retail sale (i.e. sale without transformation) of any type of physical goods, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. Goods are physical, produced objects for which a demand exists, over which ownership rights can be established and whose ownership can be transferred from one unit to another by engaging in transactions on markets. This is consistent with the definitions and concepts applied in the Balance of Payments domain, the G20 Digital Economy Task Force, the Handbook on Measuring Digital Trade etc. Wholesale and retail sale are the final steps in the distribution of merchandise. For this purpose, ancillary activities (see introductory guidelines, chapter xx) are carried out, which is considered to include a number of usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, without transforming the goods. These operations (or manipulations) include, for example, sorting, grading and assembling of goods, mixing or blending of goods (e.g. sand), bottling (with or without preceding bottle cleaning), packaging, breaking bulk and repacking for distribution in smaller lots, storage (whether or not frozen or chilled). If not carried out as usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, the mentioned activities can be carried out as principal, secondary or ancillary activities in other sections of NACE. The distinction between division 46 (wholesale) and division 47 (retail sale) is based on the type of customer. Wholesale is the resale sale of new and used goods to retailers, business-to-business trade, e.g. to industrial, commercial, institutional or professional users, or resale to other wholesalers, or involves acting as an agent or broker in buying merchandise for, or selling merchandise to, such persons or companies. The principal types of businesses included are merchant wholesalers, i.e. wholesalers who take title to the goods they sell, e.g. wholesale merchants or jobbers, industrial distributors, exporters, importers, and cooperative buying associations, sales branches and sales offices (but not retail stores) that are maintained by manufacturing or mining units apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products and that do not merely take orders to be filled by direct shipments from the plants or mines. Also included are merchandise and commodity brokers, commission merchants, agents, assemblers and buyers. If the wholesaler does not assume ownership of the goods traded, the wholesaler is classified in group 46.1. If the wholesaler assumes ownership of the goods, even if the wholesaler is acting on behalf of a third party, the wholesaler is classified in groups 46.2-46.9. Wholesalers frequently physically assemble, sort and grade goods in large lots, break bulk, repack and redistribute in smaller lots, for example pharmaceuticals; store, refrigerate, deliver and install goods, engage in sales promotion for their customers and label design. Retailing is the resale of new and used goods to final consumer for personal or household consumption or utilisation, whatever the channel, in shops, department stores, stalls, mail-order houses, door-to-door sales persons, hawkers, consumer cooperatives, auction houses etc. It includes the sale of goods via showroom (where the exposed goods can be bought), via ephemeral points of sale (e.g. pop-up stores) as well as in automated retail shops. Most retailers take title to the goods they sell, but some act as agents for a principal and sell either on consignment or on a commission basis. If the retailer does not assume ownership of the goods the retailer trades, the retailer is classified in group 47.9. If the retailer assumes ownership of the goods, even if the retailer is acting on behalf of a third party, the retailer is classified in groups 47.1-47.8. NACE does not make any distinction at group and class level between in-store and online retail sale. Most of the retail sale activities operate both in-store and online (as well other distribution channels) and it is difficult to differentiate between the two distribution/sale channels based on the primary sales methods. The share of online and in-store sales can vary over time affecting the stability of the classification. The main classification criteria for retail sale in NACE is based on what is sold and not the sale channels, and regardless of the product sold. Retailing via mail order or the internet is classified according to the type of goods sold. The distinction between wholesale and retail sale is not based on the quantity of goods sold, as wholesale may be made on a unit basis, just as retail sales may be made on a bulk basis. Instead, the primary distinction between wholesale and retail sale is the type of customer. Wholesale usually involves business as customers, and retail sale usually sell to final customers. If a trader sells to both business and final customers without distinction, and it is practically impossible to distinguish the majority type of customers, then it is recommended to treat the seller as a retailer. Blending of beverages to be provided by the manufacturer or by a contractor is classified in manufacturing (section C). If carried out as usual operation (or manipulation) associated with trade, it is considered as ancillary activity and integrated in section G.",

Thus, this section also includes non-formal instruction primarily concerned with sport and recreational activities, e.g. tennis or golf and education support activities (in groups 85.5-85.6). This section also includes education activities run by self-employed/own account/individual/independent lecturers (tutors, academics, instructors). Such activities should be classified in group 85.5.

        "Core Content Note": "This section includes education at any level or for any profession. The instructions may be oral or written and may be provided by radio, television, the internet or via correspondence. Education activities are those having an educational programme, a time frame and some evaluation of the knowledge achieved. It includes formal initial education at its different levels provided by the different institutions in the regular school system designed for students as a continuous educational pathway before their first entrance to the labour market, as well as formal education outside the regular school system with programme content and qualifications that are equivalent to those of such initial education (adult education, literacy programmes etc.). Also included are activities provided by military schools and academies, prison schools etc. at their respective levels. This section includes compulsory and non-compulsory schooling and public as well as private education. For each level of education, the classes include special education for physically or mentally disabled persons. Groups 85.1, 85.2, 85.3 and 85.4 take into account the formal education activities provided under the ISCED-P 2011 classification, that is, the international classification of educational programmes. As a consequence, the breakdown of the categories in this section is based on the level of education offered as defined by the levels of ISCED-P 2011*. The activities of educational institutions providing courses on ISCED-P 2011 level 02 are classified in 85.10, on ISCED-P 2011 level 1 in 85.20, on ISCED-P 2011 level 2 category 24 and level 3 category 34 in class 85.31, on ISCED-P 2011 2011 level 2 category 25 and level 3 category 35 in class 85.32, on ISCED-P 2011 level 4 in class 85.33 and on ISCED-P 2011 level 5-6-7-8 in group 85.4. NOTE: * Mappings between the levels of education and the name of the qualifications in national language can be found here https://europa.eu/!mDwYbG Educational institutions classified in groups 85.2 to 85.4 are authorised to certify successful completion of an educational programme, usually in the form of a document officially recognised by the relevant national education authorities.",

Mixed farming (group 01.5) breaks with the usual principles for identifying the main activity. It accepts that many agricultural units have a reasonably balanced production of crops and animals, and that it would be arbitrary to classify them in one category or the other. This division includes the soilless cultivation of crops, such as using hydroponic and aquaponic methods. IMPLEMENTATION RULE In agriculture, one frequent situation where the breakdown of the value added presents difficulties is when a unit manufactures a product from its own agricultural output. For example, when a unit produces grapes and manufactures wine from the own-produced grapes, or when it produces olives and manufactures oil from the own-produced olives. In these cases, the most suitable proxy variable is the number of hours worked. Applying this variable to these vertically integrated activities would generally lead to the classification of the units under agriculture. In the same case for other agricultural products, units will be classified in agriculture by convention, in order to guarantee harmonised treatment.",

The design of the article, for both aesthetic and functional qualities, is an important aspect of the production process. Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of manufacturing. For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in division 16. However, the multiple processes distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing. Similarly, metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacture of roll-formed products classified in division 25. The moulding process for plastics furniture is similar to the moulding of other plastics products. However, the manufacture of plastics furniture tends to be a specialised activity.",
