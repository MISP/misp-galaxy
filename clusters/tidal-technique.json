      "description": "Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.\n\nAn adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/ab823cbf-0238-4347-a191-a90d84b978f7)) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/ef0e0599-6543-499d-8409-ef449da5c38a)). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.<sup>[[Pentestlab Token Manipulation](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/243deb44-4d47-4c41-bd5d-262c4319cce5)]</sup>\n\nAny standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.",

Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.<sup>[[Malicious Chrome Extension Numbers](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/f34fcf1f-370e-4b6e-9cc4-7ee4075faf6e)]</sup> Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions.\n\nPrevious to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the <code>profiles</code> tool to install malicious <code>.mobileconfig</code> files. In macOS 11+, the use of the <code>profiles</code> tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however <code>.mobileconfig</code> files can be planted and installed with user interaction.<sup>[[xorrior chrome extensions macOS](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/84bfd3a1-bda2-4821-ac52-6af8515e5879)]</sup>\n\nOnce the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser (including credentials), and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence.<sup>[[Chrome Extension Crypto Miner](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/ae28f530-40da-451e-89b8-b472340c3e0a)]</sup><sup>[[ICEBRG Chrome Extensions](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/459bfd4a-7a9b-4d65-b574-acb221428dad)]</sup><sup>[[Banker Google Chrome Extension Steals Creds](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/93f37adc-d060-4b35-9a4d-62d2ad61cdf3)]</sup><sup>[[Catch All Chrome Extension](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/eddd2ea8-89c1-40f9-b6e3-37cbdebd210e)]</sup>\n\nThere have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions for [Command and Control](https://app.tidalcyber.com/tactics/94ffe549-1c29-438d-9c7f-e27f7acee0bb).<sup>[[Stantinko Botnet](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/d81e0274-76f4-43ce-b829-69f761e280dc)]</sup><sup>[[Chrome Extension C2 Malware](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/b0fdf9c7-614b-4269-ba3e-7d8b02aa8502)]</sup> Adversaries may also use browser extensions to modify browser permissions and components, privacy settings, and other security controls for [Defense Evasion](https://app.tidalcyber.com/tactics/8e29c6c9-0c10-4bb0-827d-ff0ab8922726).<sup>[[Browers FriarFox](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/3fe79fc8-c86d-57ad-961f-30fddd0e5f62)]</sup><sup>[[Browser Adrozek](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/48afb730-b5e1-5a85-bb60-9ef9b536e397)]</sup> ",

Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes<sup>[[FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1d57b1c8-930b-4bcb-a51e-39020327cc5d)]</sup> and to support other malicious activities, including distraction<sup>[[FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/9c8772eb-6d1d-4742-a2db-a5e1006effaa)]</sup>, hacktivism, and extortion.<sup>[[Symantec DDoS October 2014](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/878e0382-4191-4bca-8adc-c379b0d57ba8)]</sup>\n\nAn Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).\n\nTo perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.\n\nAdversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.\n\nBotnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.<sup>[[USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/69ee73c1-359f-4584-a6e7-75119d24bbf5)]</sup>\n\nIn cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.<sup>[[ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1a08d58f-bf91-4345-aa4e-2906d3ef365a)]</sup>\n\nFor attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see [Network Denial of Service](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/e6c14a7b-1fb8-4557-83e7-7f5b89717311).\n",

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.\n\nWhen initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host.

By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via [Multi-hop Proxy](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/fa05c148-56a0-43ae-b8e4-2d4e91641400) or exfiltration of data via [Traffic Duplication](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/c2fc2776-e674-46ff-8b8d-ecc90b8b1c26).

Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes<sup>[[FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1d57b1c8-930b-4bcb-a51e-39020327cc5d)]</sup> and to support other malicious activities, including distraction<sup>[[FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/9c8772eb-6d1d-4742-a2db-a5e1006effaa)]</sup>, hacktivism, and extortion.<sup>[[Symantec DDoS October 2014](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/878e0382-4191-4bca-8adc-c379b0d57ba8)]</sup>\n\nA Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies on. For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet. This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).\n\nTo perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing, and botnets.\n\nAdversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.\n\nFor DoS attacks targeting the hosting system directly, see [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/8b0caea0-602e-4117-8322-b125150f5c2a).",

      "description": "Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/34a112db-c61d-4ea2-872f-de3fc1af87a3)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.\n\nAdversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).\n\nThe observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r <sup>[[Hartrell cd00r 2002](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/739e6517-10f5-484d-8000-8818d63e7341)]</sup>, is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.\n\nOn network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable [Network Device Authentication](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/195aa08b-15fd-4019-b905-8f31bc5e2094) for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.<sup>[[Cisco Synful Knock Evolution](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/29301297-8343-4f75-8096-7fe229812f75)]</sup><sup>[[Mandiant - Synful Knock](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1f6eaa98-9184-4341-8634-5512a9c632dd)]</sup><sup>[[Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/f7ce5099-7e04-4c0b-8767-e0eec664b18e)]</sup>  To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage [Patch System Image](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/630a17c1-0176-4764-8f5c-a83f4f3e980f) due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.\n\nAdversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems.
