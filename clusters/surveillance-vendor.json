The reason for that was, as CEO Ido Erlichman put it, “strong association to the past activities of the company.” Perhaps that refers to infecting users’ devices with malware and adware, considered “high-risk” by Symantec and Malwarebytes.\nIf that wasn’t enough, Crossrider’s Founder and first CEO Koby Menachemi, was part of Unit 8200 – something that can be called Israel’s NSA. Another key person, Teddy Sagi, who is the main investor in both Crossrider and Kape Technologies, is mentioned in the Panama Papers.",

The exhibition connects regional government agencies with manufacturers from around the world, and was organised in cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior and in strategic partnership with Abu Dhabi Police GHQ. The United Arab Emirates, however, is known for human rights violations, some of which facilitated by the use of digital surveillance technology, as in the case of an iPhone spyware that was used against hundreds of activists, foreign leaders and suspected terrorists, according to Reuters. Innova’s foreign presence did not stop at ISNR. The company was also at ISS World Latin America, which took place in Panama in October 2022, and was among the sponsors of the September event of ISS World Asia Pacific 2022 in Singapore. These trade shows are not mere opportunities for display, but allow direct contact with members of intelligence agencies from various countries, law enforcement officials and government leaders or ministers.",

The technology was deployed in the case of Oratile Dikologang, a digital editor, where police \"successfully extracted\" and \"thoroughly analyzed\" thousands of messages, contacts, images, audio files, videos, and social media accounts from his phone. When contacted by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) about this surveillance activity, AccessData and its parent company Exterro declined to respond to questions about their technology's use in Botswana's press freedom violations.",

These attacks include delivering malware to extract data from apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, and Skype, as well as phishing capabilities to steal login credentials through fake landing pages. Almenta also advertises an \"Account Grabber\" feature to identify iCloud or Android accounts by sending deceptive messages to targets.\n\nAlongside WiNA-P, Almenta promotes a product called “Observer,” which offers “worldwide geo location,” as described in a blurb on Milipol’s website. A brochure for “Observer” reveals that, with only a target’s mobile phone number, the device’s location can be pinpointed and displayed on a Google Maps interface.\n\nThe company claims its tools can operate from up to 500 meters away and target as many as 50 devices simultaneously.

The Association of Appin Training Centers, a successor organization, has pursued legal action against multiple media outlets to remove references to Appin's illegal hacking operations, though this effort has faced resistance from organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and DDoSecrets. \n\nThe company's influence persists through numerous successor organizations, with former Appin employees establishing and operating their own firms that continue similar surveillance and hacking operations.",

      "description": "Babel Street provides tools that analyzes and monitors social media and other online sources for law enforcement and intelligence purposes. Used by U.S Secret Service, it can scrape data from over 25 social media sites, translate over 200 languages, and set up geo-fences with customizable filtering options. The software can also survey sentiment geographically over time and import data to other surveillance platforms like Palantir. \n\nOne of its primary AI products, Babel X, is used by the U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to analyze the social media of U.S. citizens, refugees, and asylum seekers. Babel X can link social media posts to individuals' Social Security numbers, location data, and collect a wide range of other identifiers, including IP addresses, employment history, and unique advertising identifiers. CBP also uses Locate X, an add-on that includes smartphone location data, and has access to AdID information. Locate X can zoom into a specific location and display the movements of smartphones in that area. Each phone, represented by a red dot on the map, can be tracked individually. The tool can show the path a specific device has taken, including stops at various locations. \n\nBabel Street's acquisitions include intelligence company Vertical Knowledge in 2024, Rosette, a text analytics platform, in 2022, and Dunami, a social media intelligence company, in 2020. Its board of advisers includes Robert Ashley, ex-director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.",

BI Incorporated operates the technology and manages the system for the U.S. government's Alternatives to Detention program. This program uses various surveillance tools to monitor migrants and asylum seekers awaiting their immigration proceedings. The surveillance technologies used in the Alternatives to Detention program include GPS-enabled ankle monitors, voice recognition technology, and a mobile app called SmartLINK that uses facial recognition software and geolocation for check-ins. The program's surveillance creates \"digital enclaves\" - areas with high concentrations of monitored migrants, effectively extending the border's reach into various U.S. cities and neighborhoods. \n\nAccording to The Guardian, \"BI Incorporated operates the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a surveillance system launched in 2004 and pitched as a way to keep immigrants out of detention centers while they await a court hearing on their legal status. The U.S government pays BI hundreds of millions of dollars a year to run ISAP, and in 2020, the company signed a new five-year contract with ICE for nearly $2.2 billion.\"\n\nThe company is expanding its surveillance toolkit. In April, 2023, ICE announced it was pilot testing a facial recognition smartwatch as a potential addition to their e-monitoring systems. In 2025, it was revealed that ICE intends to expand its surveillance program by fitting over 180,000 immigrants with ankle monitors (and wrist trackers for pregnant women) while they await court proceedings. These devices are supplied and managed by BI Incorporated.",

According to an Al Jazeera investigation, BTT's co-founder, Alper Tosun, proposed using the \"dual-use\" ruse to market surveillance equipment as benign telecom tools. This tactic allowed BTT to sidestep international regulations and sell powerful interception tools, such as IMSI-catchers, to repressive regimes.\n\nBTT's controversial history includes its exposure in the 2015 Hacking Team leaks, which revealed its intermediary role in supplying surveillance software to Bangladesh's National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre (NTMC). Following these revelations, BTT underwent significant transformations. It was acquired in 2017 by the Emirati firm B Research and Development but later ceased operations. However, its spyware and surveillance activities continued through corporate rebranding and restructuring.\n\nIn 2022, BTT reemerged as Ikon Arge Teknoloji, a Turkish-Singaporean entity with ties to Southeast Asia. Ikon inherited BTT's expertise and staff, including its former R&D chief Alper Tosun, before his \"retirement.\" Officially, Ikon focuses on software R&D, including drone technology, and serves Turkish government agencies like TUBITAK while maintaining a presence in Southeast Asia through its Singapore branch. Despite its claims of working in sectors like banking, Ikon's history and connections suggest a continued involvement in surveillance technologies. Lam Chee Loong is a key figure in BTT's Singapore operations.",

The project was designed to unify data streams from at least 15-16 different police agencies, integrating information from license plate readers, surveillance cameras, and arrest records into a single AI-powered application. The system has been plagued by technical problems, including data security issues where the software was found to be ingesting \"restricted cases\" that should only have been visible to select individuals. \n\nDespite these local law enforcement struggles, C3 AI has secured significantly larger government contracts, most notably a five-year, $500 million agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nIt counts Amazon Web Service as a longtime partner, and also works closely with Google Cloud.",

The company's tools enable tracking of locations, interception of calls, and turning smartphones into covert recording devices - all without the user's knowledge. One of Callyo's unique features is its ability to facilitate international wiretapping without requiring authorization from local authorities. By intercepting calls and routing them through virtual numbers to its servers, the software ensures that investigators can listen to and record conversations undetected. In Massachusetts, the Boston Police Department and State Police have faced scrutiny for using Callyo's app without obtaining proper warrants. An internal audit revealed that Massachusetts State Police had used the app in at least 250 cases without proper disclosure.\n\nThe company was acquired by Motorola Solutions in 2020.",

With funding from NSO investors as well as the government of Qatar, its systems have been found to have been operated by multiple countries, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, UAE, Hungary, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan. In November 2021, the US Commerce Department added Candiru and NSO to its trade blacklist.\n\nResearchers from Recorded Future's Insikt Group have identified active infrastructure associated with Candiru's spyware, known as DevilsTongue, in Hungary and Saudi Arabia. This spyware targets Windows systems and is believed to be deployed through spear-phishing emails, malicious links, and compromised websites.\n\nIn 2025, Integrity Partners, a U.S. investment firm, acquired Candiru’s assets for up to $30 million, moving its operations and staff to the new entity Integrity Labs Ltd., which is not subject to U.S. sanctions. The deal aims to bypass U.S. restrictions after Candiru was blacklisted in 2021 over national security concerns.",

Unit 8200 has been criticized for its surveillance activities, which include monitoring Palestinian civilians for coercive purposes and conducting surveillance on Palestinian-Americans through an intelligence-sharing arrangement with the NSA.\n\nCarbyne’s platform, marketed as an enhancement for emergency response, allows for extensive data collection from mobile devices and IoT sensors without explicit user consent. When a 911 call is made, Carbyne can automatically access the caller's precise location and video feed from their smartphone, effectively turning personal devices into surveillance tools. This capability is expanded through partnerships with major tech companies like Cisco, enabling the collection of data from smart city infrastructure, such as road cameras and streetlamps, often without the public's awareness.\n\nThe company's advisory board includes notable figures such as former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, furthering its deep ties to both the U.S. and Israeli security establishments.",

      "description": "Corsight AI is a facial recognition technology company headquartered in Israel with operations worldwide. The company specializes in developing facial recognition and surveillance technology powered by what they call \"Autonomous AI,\" which, according to the company, is based on 15 years of neuroscience research and over 250 patents. Their technology is designed to mimic human facial recognition capabilities. \n\nCorsight's technology allegedly identify individuals even when less than 50% of their face is visible. It also provides real-time alerts and video analysis and claims to identify people wearing masks. More recently, it was developing technology to create facial models from DNA. \n\nIsrael implemented a mass facial recognition program in the Gaza Strip using Corsight AI's technology. The system was deployed at military checkpoints along major evacuation routes where Palestinians were fleeing southward, creating an extensive database of Palestinian civilians without their knowledge or consent. The technology faced notable accuracy challenges, particularly when processing grainy footage or partially obscured faces. One significant case highlighting these accuracy issues involved Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha, who was wrongfully detained at a checkpoint in mid-November while attempting to leave Gaza for Egypt with his family. After being flagged by the system as a wanted person, he was held in detention for two days, during which he endured beating and interrogation, before being released back to Gaza without explanation.\n\nAccording to Gizmodo, in 2024 Corsight AI introduced a new surveillance system that monitors \"sweethearting\" - a practice where retail employees give unauthorized discounts to people they know - by analyzing customer-employee interactions, including physical proximity and visit patterns. The technology, which has already been implemented by unnamed clients, tracks whether customers consistently visit the same employees and triggers security alerts for suspicious patterns.\n\nCorsight also announced a partnership with the public school system in Alagoas, a state in Northeastern Brazil, to implement its facial recognition technology in schools. However, the contract raised transparency concerns: while Alagoas had an active agreement with Teltex, a company acting as Corsight's reseller in Brazil, the contract made no mention of Corsight or the facial recognition solution. This practice violates local laws.",

One of their flagship products, FaceWatch Plus, offers \"continuous screening and monitoring of live video streams,\" as described on the company's website. This technology was adopted by law enforcement agencies in cities like Chicago and Detroit, enabling real-time identification from live video feeds. Another one of their products, FaceCompare Plus, offers standalone morphological facial comparison, allowing agencies to compare two facial images side-by-side without a full facial recognition system.\n\nThe use of DataWorks Plus' technology has raised significant concerns, particularly regarding its reliability and potential for racial bias. In Detroit, the police department's use of this facial recognition technology has been criticized for its almost exclusive application against Black people in 2020. The department's own data revealed that the technology frequently misidentifies people, with Former Detroit Police Chief James Craig admitting that the system almost never brings back a direct match and often leads to incorrect identifications. \n\nDespite these issues, DataWorks Plus does not provide specific guidance to law enforcement on how to use the software, leaving decisions largely to the discretion of individual officers. This lack of oversight, combined with the technology's unreliability, has led to wrongful arrests and raised serious concerns among human rights advocates about the broader implications for privacy and racial justice.",

      "description": "Dreamlab Technologies, a Swiss company, was involved in a surveillance project in Turkmenistan in partnership with Gamma International GmbH (creators of the FinFisher spyware). Documents leaked by WikiLeaks revealed that Dreamlab helped establish an \"Infection Proxy Infrastructure\" on Turkmenistan's networks, enabling widespread surveillance. This infrastructure allowed for the infection of devices through fake software updates, file downloads, or website injections, granting full access to personal data, emails, social media messages, and even enabling remote control of microphones and cameras. Dreamlab provided technical services, including network analysis, hardware and software installation, staff training, and system maintenance. The leaked documents suggest the two companies also collaborated for similar interception projects in Oman.\n\nAccording to Intelligence Online, Dreamlab has since diversified its operations, creating new ventures like Slinf, a threat intelligence firm co-founded with German SIGINT experts, which develops tools such as RATspotting for detecting command-and-control servers and CyKnife for open-source intelligence. Dreamlab previously collaborated with German defense group Rheinmetall to create the consulting firm Cyel. In 2019, Cyel was split, with part of its operations integrated into Dreamlab and the rest taken over by Rheinmetall under the name Cyber Works.\n\nDreamlab maintains offices in Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Oman, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Bolivia, Peru, India, Malaysia and Chile.",

When activated, Falcon emits signals that compel nearby mobile phones and other cellular devices to connect to it, revealing their exact locations. Falcon includes a smaller, pocket-sized device that can be used by agents on foot to track cellphone locations even more precisely, narrowing down to within 1 meter.

The initiative was described as a \"game changer\" by Police Chief Roni Alsheikh. However, Fifth Dimension ceased operations due to U.S. sanctions on one of its investors, Viktor Vekselberg, which affected its primary market in the U.S.\n\nThe company ceased operations in December 2018, after an unsuccessful acquisition bid from NSO Group.

The company's web application, Fog Reveal, provides detailed histories of people's lives, selling access for less than $10,000 per year. In the U.S alone, Fog has past or ongoing contractual relationships with at least 18 local, state, and federal law enforcement clients. Fog's service allows for \"pattern of life\" analyses, revealing an individual's daily routines and habits. The service can execute broad searches, such as gathering device IDs for everyone in a specific area.\n\nThe company also uses a \"Project Intake Form\" that requests detailed information about persons of interest, including their medical provider locations, and harvests location data from smartphones through apps and advertising systems. Critics, including former law enforcement officials, have expressed alarm over the tool’s ability to track individuals in private spaces, such as homes, without judicial oversight.\n\nThe company was founded in 2016 by two former Department of Homeland Security officials, Robert Liscouski and Matthew Broderick, who served under President George W.

Amnesty International uncovered connections between Innefu Labs and the Donot Team, a notorious hacker group responsible for targeting activists with spyware. This spyware, used in attacks on a Togolese human rights defender, could access sensitive data, including photos, files, and encrypted messages.\n\nThe company also provides the facial recognition software AI Vision, used by police in several Indian states for surveillance purposes, including during protests. This technology, which incorporates gait and body analysis, has sparked debates about privacy and the potential for misuse in monitoring dissent. Their clients include the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Border Security Force (BSF) in India.",

Once activated, LianSpy hides its icon from the home screen and runs silently in the background with administrator privileges. It discreetly monitors user activity by intercepting call logs, sending a list of installed applications to the attackers' server, and recording the smartphone's screen, particularly during messaging activities. According to researchers, LianSpy is a post-exploitation malware, indicating that the attackers either exploited an unknown vulnerability in Android devices or gained physical access to the victims' smartphones to modify the firmware.",

When researchers began to uncover information about Hacking Team’s operations, the primary targets were human rights activists and journalists. Hacking Team's former chairman, Paolo Lezzi, became the owner of Memento Labs and its parent company, InTheCyber. Memento Labs develops various snooping products, such as KRAIT, a surveillance tool that can silently infect any Android device without the target’s knowledge. It uses a \"trusted implant\" to appear as a legitimate source, making it easy to trick users into installing it. Once installed, KRAIT can steal passwords, monitor the device's location, microphone, camera, calls, and messages, all while hiding its activity through trusted online services. Another product, RCS X, is the latest version of a powerful spyware that has been used against journalists and human rights activists since 2012. It can infect almost any device, including macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and BlackBerry, using security vulnerabilities. Once installed, RCS X allows hackers to control microphones, cameras, and take screenshots, while managing all infections from a single console. \n\nAt a monitoring conference in Dubai, Memento Labs introduced two new tools: MoniTOR and PrevenTer. PrevenTer is designed for speech recognition and transcribing call recordings. MoniTOR is aimed at helping law enforcement track activities by attempting to exploit any technical vulnerabilities to bypass anonymization methods used by the Tor network. However, these tools were not developed by the company itself, it was developed via a research collaboration with the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) and funded by the Swiss Agency for Innovation Promotion, Innosuisse. SUPSI and Memento Labs' parent company, In The Cyber, have contractual agreements to jointly develop software products.",

One of its operations, known as Project Raven, involved ex-U.S. intelligence operatives conducting cyber-espionage on behalf of the UAE. This included hacking into email accounts, tracking individuals' movements, and gathering private data. Journalists were specifically targeted to suppress dissent and monitor media activities critical of the UAE government.\n\nIn 2023, OryxLabs was acquired by EDGE, the defense conglomerate based in the UAE.",

Founded in 2019 by Yoad Gidron, a former technical director at Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, alongside Nimrod Schwartz and Rafi Ton of digital advertising firm NUVIAD, Patternz leverages Mobile Advertising ID (MAID) technology to track individuals' locations in real time and build comprehensive target profiles. This approach is often used to bypass the need for legal warrants and benefits from more flexible export regulations compared to traditional surveillance tools.\n\nThe company’s platform not only enables precise tracking and profiling but can also issue alerts when a target reaches specific destinations. Patternz is reportedly working on even more advanced solutions, including the integration of spyware capabilities into the ad-tech stack, potentially deploying Trojans through advertising frameworks. In January 2024, the business development firm Improvate The Future (ITF) filed a lawsuit against Patternz for alleged non-payment of services. ITF, which boasts a high-profile advisory board including former Israeli cybersecurity chief Yigal Unna and several ex-prime ministers, had previously facilitated Patternz's participation in international cyber delegations. \n\nUdi Doenyas, Patternz’s technical director, is a former architect of NSO Group's Pegasus spyware and has been a key figure in the company’s operations.",

This arrangement allowed PicSix to conduct business with countries that typically avoid direct dealings with Israel.\n\nDuring product demonstrations to Bangladeshi intelligence officials, PicSix representatives reportedly conducted unauthorized phone interceptions in Hungary.\n\nAnother notable product in their lineup is P6-FI5, a portable interception system that creates deceptive cell towers compatible with GSM, 3G, and 4G networks. This device employs a sophisticated strategy to bypass encryption: it deliberately disrupts encrypted applications on target devices, forcing users to switch to less secure, easily interceptable communication methods. Additionally, the system can deploy malware to any device connected to its counterfeit cell tower.",

This capability enables intelligence services to conduct long-term surveillance and execute Man-in-the-Middle attacks to access encrypted communications. Captured data is redirected via VPN tunnels for detailed analysis.\n\nRN's technology exploits vulnerabilities in router firmware to gain remote access. By mapping and infiltrating vulnerable routers, the company establishes its own interception network, independent of traditional operators. This network allows RN to monitor target devices, such as smartphones and computers, and deploy spyware for further surveillance.\n\nRoot Networks was founded by Avi Yarim, a former Rayzone Group specialist, and was led by CTO Shahar Mor, an ex-cybersecurity researcher at Verint. The company shares investors with Rayzone Group, including prominent figures like Yohai Ben-Zakai, a former deputy commander of Unit 8200, and businessman Eran Reshef.",

The company develops and distributes in AI-powered drones equipped with autonomous capabilities and computer vision systems. Since launching their R1 drone in 2018, Skydio has served over 1,200 enterprise customers including every branch of the U.S. military.\n\nSkydio became the first U.S. drone company to reach a $1 billion valuation, generating over $100 million in annual revenue in 2023, with 30% coming from software solutions. The company has a local office in Israel and sells its drones to the Israeli military. The Israeli company DefenSync is its authorized partner in Israel.\n\nBased on a report by Theia Chatelle, the Yale Police Department (YPD) utilized Skydio drones as part of their surveillance program targeting pro-Palestine student protesters. \n\nAccording to a Wired investigation, a Skydio X10 drone equipped with multiple high-resolution cameras, thermal imaging, powerful zoom capabilities, and onboard AI was detected monitoring pro-Palestine protesters at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, with the same drone later being spotted above the Israeli consulate during subsequent protests.\n\nIn October 2025, The Washington Post revealed that Skydio provided the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) remote-controlled drones, reportedly used to film protesters and monitor public demonstrations.",

The platform was marketed to law enforcement agencies, schools, and other organizations, enabling users to track keywords, hashtags, and geographic areas of interest. \n\nLaw enforcement agencies across the United States utilized Snaptrends to track targets and monitor public events. For example, the software was reportedly used to increase arrest rates during specific operations. Snaptrends was also used to monitor students' social media activity, often in collaboration with schools. \n\nThe company promoted social media analytics tools to authorities in Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Malaysia, Turkey, and other countries known to suppress online speech, according to confidential company documents and interviews with current and former employees. Beginning in 2013, Snaptrends pursued business in Saudi Arabia, entering a $500,000 agreement with a company linked to the royal family to sell its technology. The company also engaged with the Saudi Ministry of Interior and intelligence agencies. It has also done business with the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn 2014, Brandon Burris, Snaptrends co-founder and chief technology officer at the time, flew to Hong Kong as part of a $300,000 deal with a local holding company Faith Concord. According to corporate filings in China, Faith Concord owns BaoLiDa, which markets its ability to monitor citizens’ activities on the internet to the Chinese government.\n\nSnaptrends faced criticism for targeting activists or disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. These concerns led platforms like Twitter to sever ties with Snaptrends, cutting off access to their data in 2016. Snaptrends ceased operations later that year, laying off its staff and shutting down quietly.",

The accuracy of ShotSpotter has been called into question, with reports indicating that the system can misidentify sounds, leading to unnecessary and dangerous police deployments as well as over-policing in various communities.

The system integrates AI-powered profiling and automated alerts for use by border officials, connecting governments with transport operators, and uses its AI for decision-making on which passengers to prevent from entering a country.\n\nAccording to a report by Wired, Travizory uses its algorithms to analyze up to 150 variables, including travel patterns, connections to known persons of interest, and anomalies in behavior. For example, the system can flag travelers whose behavior deviates from typical patterns, such as short visits with excessive luggage or unusual spending habits. These assessments are used to generate risk classifications, which are shared with government agencies, including customs, immigration, and intelligence services. Currently operational in Kenya and the Seychelles, Travizory is also in discussions to expand its system to 20 other African countries.",

Verint's technology is employed in over 75 countries and can be used for nationwide mass interception, voice identification, and data mining to build detailed profiles of individuals.\n\nVerint sold their technology to repressive regimes worldwide, including in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, South Sudan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The technology sold to Azerbaijan was reportedly used to identify the sexual orientations of individuals through social media, leading to the targeting and arrest of LGBTQ+ individuals. In Bahrain, Verint products have been used to gather data from social networks, contributing to the repression of dissidents for their online activities. Additionally, in Indonesia, Verint's technology has been employed to compile databases of LGBTQ+ rights activists and monitor religious minorities.\n\nVerint has also been linked to surveillance operations in South Sudan, where it provided communications interception equipment and support services to the government. This arrangement required the telecommunications company Vivacell to pay Verint over $762,000 to facilitate the interception of citizens' communications, as reported by Amnesty International.",
