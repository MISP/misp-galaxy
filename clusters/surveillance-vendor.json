The reason for that was, as CEO Ido Erlichman put it, “strong association to the past activities of the company.” Perhaps that refers to infecting users’ devices with malware and adware, considered “high-risk” by Symantec and Malwarebytes.\nIf that wasn’t enough, Crossrider’s Founder and first CEO Koby Menachemi, was part of Unit 8200 – something that can be called Israel’s NSA. Another key person, Teddy Sagi, who is the main investor in both Crossrider and Kape Technologies, is mentioned in the Panama Papers.",

The exhibition connects regional government agencies with manufacturers from around the world, and was organised in cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior and in strategic partnership with Abu Dhabi Police GHQ. The United Arab Emirates, however, is known for human rights violations, some of which facilitated by the use of digital surveillance technology, as in the case of an iPhone spyware that was used against hundreds of activists, foreign leaders and suspected terrorists, according to Reuters. Innova’s foreign presence did not stop at ISNR. The company was also at ISS World Latin America, which took place in Panama in October 2022, and was among the sponsors of the September event of ISS World Asia Pacific 2022 in Singapore. These trade shows are not mere opportunities for display, but allow direct contact with members of intelligence agencies from various countries, law enforcement officials and government leaders or ministers.",
