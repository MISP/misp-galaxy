      "description": "[NotPetya](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0368) is malware that was first seen in a worldwide attack starting on June 27, 2017. The main purpose of the malware appeared to be to effectively destroy data and disk structures on compromised systems. Though [NotPetya](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0368) presents itself as a form of ransomware, it appears likely that the attackers never intended to make the encrypted data recoverable. As such, [NotPetya](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0368) may be more appropriately thought of as a form of wiper malware. [NotPetya](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0368) contains worm-like features to spread itself across a computer network using the SMBv1 exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance.(Citation: Talos Nyetya June 2017)(Citation: Talos Nyetya June 2017)(Citation: US-CERT NotPetya 2017)",
