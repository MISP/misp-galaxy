      "description": "According to Cyble, this is an advanced Android malware evolved from SpySolr that features remote control, credential theft, and data exfiltration. It spreads via phishing sites impersonating streaming services like iNat TV and fake mining platforms. The malware abuses Android’s Accessibility Service to unlock devices, log keystrokes, and automate credential theft through injections. It uses WebSocket-based C&C communication for real-time command execution and data theft. BTMOB RAT supports various malicious actions, including live screen sharing, file management, audio recording, and web injections.",

After installation and activation, the app creates fake Gmail, Google Play and Chrome icons. Furthermore, the malware sends a fake system notification, telling the victim that they need to re-authenticate with Google Services and ask for their credit card details to be entered.\r\nCurrently the malware has overlays for over 2,200 apps of banks and financial institutions.",

      "description": "According to Lookout, PlainGnome consists of a two-stage deployment in which a very minimal first stage drops a malicious APK once it’s installed. The code of PlainGnome’s second stage payload evolved significantly from January 2024 through at least October. In particular, PlainGnome’s developers shifted to using Jetpack WorkManager classes to handle data exfiltration, which eases development and maintenance of related code. In addition, WorkManager allows for specifying execution conditions. For example, PlainGnome only exfiltrates data from victim devices when the device enters an idle state. This mechanism is probably intended to reduce the chance of a victim noticing the presence of PlainGnome on their device. As opposed to the minimalist first (installer) stage, the second stage carries out all surveillance functionality and relies on 38 permissions.",

Goal of the campaign is to steal victims’ assets from finance and banking applications (such as cryptocurrency wallets, credentials for official bank apps on mobile, and money in deposit), via a banking trojan they named TgToxic (based on its special encrypted filename) embedded in multiple fake apps. While previously targeting users in Taiwan, Trend Micro observed the fraudulent activities and phishing lures targeting users from Thailand and Indonesia as of this writing. Users are advised to be wary of opening embedded links from unknown email and message senders, and to avoid downloading apps from third party platforms.",

The code in the loader webshell includes obfuscated variable names and the embedded payload is encoded and encrypted. To interact with the loader webshell, the threat actor uses HTTP POST requests to the compromised server.\r\n\r\nThe secondary webshell, which we call the payload, is embedded within the loader in encrypted form and contains additional functionality that we will discuss in further detail. When the threat actor wants to interact with the remote server, they provide data that the loader will use to modify a decryption key embedded within the loader that will be in turn used to decrypt the embedded TwoFace payload. Commands supported by the payload are execution of programs, up-, download and deletion of files and capability to manipulate MAC timestamps.",

      "description": "ALPHV, also known as BlackCat or Noberus, is a ransomware family that is deployed as part of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operations. ALPHV is written in the Rust programming language and supports execution on Windows, Linux-based operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ReadyNAS, Synology), and VMWare ESXi. ALPHV is marketed as ALPHV on cybercrime forums, but is commonly called BlackCat by security researchers due to an icon of a black cat appearing on its leak site. ALPHV has been observed being deployed in ransomware attacks since November 18, 2021.\r\n\r\nALPHV can be configured to encrypt files using either the AES or ChaCha20 algorithms. In order to maximize the amount of ransomed data, ALPHV can delete volume shadow copies, stop processes and services, and stop virtual machines on ESXi servers. ALPHV can self-propagate by using PsExec to remote execute itself on other hosts on the local network.",

      "description": "MrBlack, first identified in May 2014 by Russian security firm Dr. Web, is a botnet that targets Linux OS and is designed to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In May 2015, Incapsula clients suffered a large-scale DDoS attack which the company attributed to network traffic generated by tens of thousands of small office/home office (SOHO) routers infected with MrBlack. This massive botnet spans over 109 countries, especially in Thailand and Brazil.\r\n\r\nMrBlack scans for and infects routers that have not had their default login credentials changed and that allow remote access to HTTP and SSH via port 80 and port 22, respectively. One of the most impacted router brands is Ubiquiti, a U.S.-based firm that provides bulk network hub solutions for internet service providers to lease to their customers. Once a vulnerable router is compromised and MrBlack is injected into the system, a remote server is contacted and system information from the device is transmitted. This allows the host server to receive commands in order to perform different types of DDoS attacks, download and execute files, and terminate processes.",

      "description": "According to Black Lotus Labs, Nosedive is a custom variation of the Mirai implant that is supported on all major SOHO and IoT architectures (e.g. MIPS, ARM, SuperH, PowerPC, etc.). Nosedive implants are typically deployed from Tier 2 payload servers in the Raptor Train infrastructure through a unique URL encoding scheme and domain injection method. Nosedive droppers use this method to request payloads for specific C2s by encoding the requested C2 domain and joining it with a unique \"key\" that identifies the bot and the target architecture of the compromised device (e.g. MIPS, ARM, etc.), which is then injected into the Nosedive implant payload that is deployed to the Tier 1 node. Once deployed, Nosedive runs in-memory only and allows the operators to execute commands, upload and download files, and run DDoS attacks on compromised devices. \r\n\r\nThe malware and its associated droppers are memory-resident only and deleted from disk. This, in addition to anti-forensics techniques employed on these devices including the obfuscation of running process names, compromising devices through a multi-stage infection chain, and killing remote management processes, makes detection and forensics much more difficult.

Unique methods are used to interact with PUMA, including using the rmdir() syscall for privilege escalation and specialized commands for extracting configuration and runtime information. \r\n\r\nKey functionalities of the kernel module include privilege escalation, hiding files and directories, concealing itself from system tools, anti-debugging measures, and establishing communication with command-and-control (C2) servers.\r\n\r\nThere is also an accompanying userland SO rootkit internally referred to as Kitsune.",

Every victim is provided with a different, unique Bitcoin wallet—this could help the attackers avoid being traced.\r\n\r\n3.

SALTWATER can upload or download arbitrary files, execute commands, and has proxy and tunneling capabilities. The backdoor is implemented using hooks on the send, recv, close syscalls via the 3rd party kubo/funchook hooking library, and amounts to five components, most of which are referred to as \"Channels\" within the binary. In addition to providing backdoor and proxying capabilities, these components exhibit classic backdoor functionality.",

The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the Threat Actor’s Command-and-Control through TCP packets. When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (SMTP) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string. When the right sequence of packet is captured, it establishes a TCP reverse shell to the C2 server for further exploitation. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.\r\nThe malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named \"cd00r\".",

The commands are indexed by 16-bit integers, starting with the value 0x27C3.\r\n\r\nSimpleTea for Linux seems like an updated version of BadCall for Linux, rewritten from C to C++, as there are similarities in class names and function names between the two.",

First created in 2019, the tool gained significant attention in 2022 when various obfuscated client versions began appearing on VirusTotal starting January 18, 2022. The RAT's features were detailed on its now-defunct website (hxxps://sorillus[.]com), where it was marketed for lifetime access at 59.99€, with a discounted price of 19.99€ at the time. Payments were conveniently accepted via various cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nThe creator and distributor of Sorillus, a YouTube user known as \"Tapt,\" claimed the tool could collect sensitive information from infected systems, including:\r\n\r\n    HardwareID\r\n\r\n    Username\r\n\r\n    Country\r\n\r\n    Language\r\n\r\n    Webcam footage\r\n\r\n    Headless status\r\n\r\n    Operating system details\r\n\r\n    Client version\r\n\r\nHowever, Sorillus was shut down in 2025 following the FBI's Operation \"Talent,\" which targeted alot of the Cracking infrastucture which included Sellix, the payment portal used by Sorillus for transactions. This operation disrupted the financial infrastructure supporting the RAT, leading to its cessation of operations 5 days later.",

The RAT has a focus on stealing credentials of browsers and email clients, and passwords via keylogging. It supports the following browsers and email clients: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Foxmail, Outlook, Thunderbird.\r\n\r\nSince Version 1.2 and above, STRRAT was infamous for its ransomware-like behavior of appending the file name extension .crimson to files. Version 1.5 is notably more obfuscated and modular than previous versions, but the backdoor functions mostly remain the same: collect browser passwords, run remote commands and PowerShell, log keystrokes, among others. Version 1.5 of STRRAT Malware includes a proper encryption routine, though currently pretty simple to revert.",

The observed payloads have common characteristics. All are similarly obfuscated, with variable and function names replaced with random-looking strings. Furthermore, strings used by the code, such as webmail and C&C server URLs, are also obfuscated and contained in an encrypted list. Each of those strings is only decrypted when it is used. Note that the variable and function names are randomized for each sample, so the final SpyPress payloads will have different hashes. Another common characteristic is that there are no persistence or update mechanisms. The payload is fully contained in the email and only executed when the email message is viewed from a vulnerable webmail instance.\r\n\r\nFinally, all payloads communicate with their hardcoded C&C servers via HTTP POST requests. There is a small number of C&C servers that are shared by all payloads (there is no separation by victim or payload type).",

Once a user has double-clicked the embedded image, the form executes a VB setup script.  The script writes files to the path %appdata%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\, then creates two task entries triggered to run daily.  The scripts are responsible for deobfuscating and executing the main JavaScript file mspromo.dot.  The file uses a character insertion obfuscation technique, making it appear to contain Chinese characters.  After deobfuscating the file, the main JavaScript is easily recognizable.  It contains a number of functions designed to drop files and execute scripts on a host system.  The SQLRat script is designed to make a direct SQL connection to a Microsoft database controlled by the attackers and execute the contents of various tables.",

      "description": "CoinThief was a malware package designed to steal Bitcoins from the victim, consisting of a binary patcher, browser extensions, and a backdoor component. \r\n\r\nIt was spreading in early 2014 from several different sources: \r\n- on Github (where the trojanized compiled binary didn’t match the displayed source code), o\r\n- on popular and trusted download sites line CNET's Download.com or MacUpdate.com, and \r\n- as cracked applications via torrents camouflaged as Bitcoin Ticker TTM, BitVanity, StealthBit, Litecoin Ticker, BBEdit, Pixelmator, Angry Birds and Delicious Library.\r\n\r\nThe patcher‘s role was to locate and modify legitimate versions of the Bitcoin-Qt wallet application. The analyzed malware samples targeted versions of Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.1, 0.8.0 and 0.8.5. The earlier patch modified Bitcoin-Qt adding malicious code that would send nearly all the victim’s Bitcoins to one of the hard-coded addresses belonging to the attacker. \r\n\r\nThe browser extensions targeted Chrome and Firefox and are disguised as a “Pop-up blocker”. The extensions monitored visited websites, download malicious JavaScripts and injected them into various Bitcoin-related websites (mostly Bitcoin exchanges and online wallet sites). The injected JS scripts were able to modify transactions to redirect Bitcoin transfers to an attacker’s address or simply harvest login credentials to the targeted online service.\r\n\r\nThe backdoor enabled the attacker to take full control over the victim’s computer:\r\n- collect information about the infected computer\r\n- execute arbitrary shell scripts on the target computer\r\n- upload an arbitrary file from the victim’s hard drive to a remote server\r\n- update itself to a newer version",

After launching the fake application, the main window of the fake cracking tool was displayed.\r\n\r\nThe file encryption process was launched after the misguided victim clicked 'Start'. Once executed, the ransomware generated a random 25-character string and set it as the key for RC4 encryption of all of the user's files. It then demanded ransom in Bitcoin, as instructed in the 'README!' .txt file copied all over the user's directories.\r\n\r\nDespite the instructions being quite thorough, Patcher lacked the functionality to communicate with any C&C server, and therefore made it impossible for its operators to decrypt affected files. The randomly generated encryption key was also too long to be guessed via a brute-force attack, leaving the encrypted data unrecoverable in a reasonable amount of time.",

The design of this malware framework appears to attempt to minimize artifacts left on infected systems by facilitating the delivery and execution of modules in-memory, without requiring them to be written to disk.

Multiple delivered plugins are designed to target sensitive information - including credentials from popular browsers (Brave, Chrome, Firefox, Edge), Outlook data, and cryptocurrency wallets. The Formgrabber plugin includes web injection methods by dynamically manipulating HTML content, modifying JA3 fingerprints via cipher suite reordering, and employing a man-in-the-middle proxy setup to intercept the traffic. GhostWeaver’s and plugins’ delivery on systems that are not part of an Active Directory domain suggests that attackers are extending their reach beyond typical corporate targets, aligning with a financially motivated agenda that exploits environments with weaker security controls.",

      "description": "According to Trend Micro, SilentPrism is a backdoor malware designed to achieve persistence, dynamically execute shell commands, and maintain unauthorized remote control of compromised systems. It implements persistence mechanisms differently based on user privileges: for non-administrative users, it leverages the Windows registry to create auto-run entries using mshta.exe combined with VBScript to download and execute remote payloads; for administrative users, it deploys scheduled tasks with similar execution methods. SilentPrism retrieves additional payloads and instructions from a C&C server, ensuring modular functionality. The malware communicates with its C&C server using encrypted channels, employing AES encryption and Base64 encoding to obfuscate data. Commands received are decrypted and executed in various ways, including direct PowerShell script execution, dynamic script block creation, or job-based execution. Each task is tracked using unique identifiers, allowing the malware to monitor execution states and return results to the server. SilentPrism incorporates anti-analysis techniques such as virtual machine detection and randomized sleep intervals (ranging from 300 to 700 milliseconds) between operations, making its behavior less predictable. Additionally, it continuously polls the C&C server for commands, enabling operators to dynamically control infected systems. ",

Notably, PXA Stealer is capable of decrypting browser master passwords to exfiltrate stored credentials. The campaign leverages heavily obfuscated batch scripts for delivery and execution. The actor behind this operation is linked to the Telegram channel “Mua Bán Scan MINI,” known to host credential trade and cybercrime activity.

      "description": "Agent Racoon is a .NET-based backdoor malware that leverages DNS for covert C2 communication, employing randomized subdomains and Punycode encoding to evade detection. It features encrypted communication using a unique key per sample, supports remote command execution, and facilitates file transfers. Despite lacking an inherent persistence mechanism, it relies on external methods like scheduled tasks for execution. The malware, active since at least 2020, has targeted organizations in the U.S., Middle East, and Africa, including non-profits and government sectors. It disguises itself as legitimate binaries such as Google Update and MS OneDrive Updater, using obfuscation techniques like Base64 encoding and timestamp modifications to avoid detection​.",

It can also perform flood attacks via Slowloris and Layer 7.\r\n\r\nThis bot can also be set up as a SOCKS proxy to abuse the infected machine as a proxy for any protocols.\r\n\r\nThis malware family can download and execute arbitrary files, and update itself.

      "description": "A new form of ransomware named AlphaLocker that is built by cybercriminals for cybercriminals. Like all incarnations of Ransomware As A Service (RaaS), the AlphaLocker malware program can be purchased and launched by pretty much anyone who wants to get into the ransomware business. What makes AlphaLocker different from other forms of RaaS is its relatively cheap cost. The ransomware can be purchased for just $65 in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAlphaLocker, also known as Alpha Ransomware, is based on the EDA2 ransomware, an educational project open-sourced on GitHub last year by Turkish researcher Utku Sen. A Russian coder seems to have cloned this repository before it was taken down and used it to create his ransomware, a near-perfect clone of EDA2. The ransomware's author, is said to be paying a great deal of attention to updating the ransomware with new features, so it would always stay ahead of antivirus engines, and evade detection.\r\n\r\nAlphaLocker's encryption process starts when the ransomware contacts its C&C server. The server generates a public and a private key via the RSA-2048 algorithm, sending the public key to the user's computer and saving the private key to its server. On the infected computer, the ransomware generates an AES-256 key for each file it encrypts, and then encrypts this key with the public RSA key, and sent to the C&C server.\r\n\r\nTo decrypt their files, users have to get ahold of the private RSA key which can decrypt the AES-encrypted files found on their computers. Users have to pay around 0.35 Bitcoin (~$450) to get this key, packaged within a nice decrypter.",

This is because of a similar project, dubbed “Project Ares,” was previously uploaded to GitHub as a proof-of-concept (PoC) by the well-regarded user and red teamer “CerberSec.”\r\n\r\nThe loader mimics legitimate software to trick victims into executing malware with administrator rights on their machines. Additional features of the loader include:\r\n\r\n1. Written in C/C++\r\n2. Supports 64-bit payloads\r\n3. Makes it look like malware spawned by another process\r\n4. Prevents non-Microsoft signed binaries from being injected into malware\r\n5. Hides suspicious imported Windows APIs\r\n6. Leverages anti-analysis techniques to avoid reverse engineering\r\n\r\nFurthermore, It was observed that SystemBC, Amadey, and several Raccoon Stealers were directly installing AresLoader. To date, the AresLoader downloader has been seen delivering payloads like SystemBC, Lumma Stealer, StealC, Aurora Stealer, and Laplas Clipper.",

Its most interesting features are a complex modular architecture, elaborate network communications, and a unique plugin to fingerprint GSM/GPRS devices.\r\n\r\nAttor’s core lies in its dispatcher, which serves as a management unit for additional plugins which provide all of malware’s key capabilities. This allows the attackers to customize the platform on a per-victim basis. Plugins themselves are heavily synchronized. Network communication is based on Tor, aiming for anonymity and untraceability. \r\n\r\nThe most notable plugin can detect connected GSM/GPRS modems or mobile devices. Attor speaks to them directly using the AT command set, in order to collect sensitive information such as the IMEI, IMSI or MSISDN numbers, possibly identifying both the device and its subscriber. Other plugins provide persistence, an exfiltration channel, C&C communication and several further spying capabilities. The plugin responsible for capturing victim's screen targets social networks and blogging platforms, email services, office software, archiving utilities, file sharing and messaging services.",

As in many RATs from Lazarus arsenal, the commands are indexed by 32-bit integers. However, in this case the indicis are convertible into a meaningful ASCII representation, that even suggests the functionality: SLEP, HIBN, DRIV, DIR, DIRP, CHDR, RUN, RUNX, DEL, WIPE, MOVE, FTIM, NEWF, DOWN, ZDWN, UPLD, PVEW, PKIL, CMDL, DIE, GCFG, SCFG, TCON, PEEX, PEIN.\r\n\r\nIt has aclui.dll as the internal DLL name. It contains statically linked code from open-source libraries like libcurl (version 7.47.1) or zLib (version 0.15).\r\n\r\nBanPolMex RAT was delivered for victims of a watering hole campaign targeting employees of Polish and Mexican banks, that was discovered in February 2017. It is usually loaded by HOTWAX.",

The threat actors also use the double extortion method by stealing an affected organization’s files and leaking them online if the ransom is not paid on time. BianLian gains access to victim systems through valid Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, uses open-source tools and command-line scripting for discovery and credential harvesting, and exfiltrates victim data via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Rclone, or Mega. BianLian originally employed a double-extortion model in which they encrypted victims’ systems after exfiltrating the data; however, around January 2023, they shifted to primarily exfiltration-based extortion. The BianLian ransomware uses goroutines and encrypts files in chunks to quickly hijack an infected system. The ransomware adds its own extension to each encrypted file. ",

The malicious tool can perform a wide range of operations, including data exfiltration, UAC bypass, DDoS attacks, clipboard monitoring, gaining unauthorized webcam access, credential theft, audio recording, XMRig coin mining and generic keylogging.",

      "description": "ALPHV, also known as BlackCat or Noberus, is a ransomware family that is deployed as part of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operations. ALPHV is written in the Rust programming language and supports execution on Windows, Linux-based operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ReadyNAS, Synology), and VMWare ESXi. ALPHV is marketed as ALPHV on cybercrime forums, but is commonly called BlackCat by security researchers due to an icon of a black cat appearing on its leak site. ALPHV has been observed being deployed in ransomware attacks since November 18, 2021.\r\n\r\nALPHV can be configured to encrypt files using either the AES or ChaCha20 algorithms. In order to maximize the amount of ransomed data, ALPHV can delete volume shadow copies, stop processes and services, and stop virtual machines on ESXi servers. ALPHV can self-propagate by using PsExec to remote execute itself on other hosts on the local network.",

      "description": "BlackEnergy, its first version shortened as BE1, started as a crimeware being sold in the Russian cyber underground as early as 2007. Initially, it was designed as a toolkit for creating botnets for conducting DDoS attacks. It supported a variety of flooding commands including protocols like ICMP, TCP SYN, UDP, HTTP and DNS. Among the high profile targets of cyber attacks utilising BE1 were a Norwegian bank and government websites in Georgia three weeks before Russo-Georgian War.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 of BlackEnergy, BE2, came in 2008 with a complete code rewrite that introduced a protective layer, a kernel-mode rootkit and a modular architecture. Plugins included mostly DDoS attacks, a spam plugin and two banking authentication plugins to steal from Russian nad Ukrainian banks. The banking plugin was paired with a module designed to destroy the filesystem. Moreover, BE2 was able to\r\n- download and execute a remote file;\r\n- execute a local file on the infected computer;\r\n- update the bot and its plugins;\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an alert warning that BE2 was leveraging the human-machine interfaces of industrial control systems like GE CIMPLICITY, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC to gain access to critical infrastructure networks.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the BlackEnergy toolkit, BE3, switched to a lighter footprint with no kernel-mode driver component. Its plugins included:\r\n- operations with victim's filesystem\r\n- spreading with a parasitic infector\r\n- spying features like keylogging, screenshoots or a robust password stealer\r\n- Team viewer and a simple pseudo “remote desktop”\r\n- listing Windows accounts and scanning network \r\n- destroying the system\r\n\r\nTypical for distribution of BE3 was heavy use of spear-phishing emails containing Microsoft Word or Excel documents with a malicious VBA macro, Rich Text Format (RTF) documents embedding exploits or a PowerPoint presentation with zero-day exploit CVE-2014-4114.\r\n\r\nOn 23 December 2015, attackers behind the BlackEnergy malware successfully caused power outages for several hours in different regions of Ukraine. This cyber sabotage against three energy companies has been confirmed by the Ukrainian government. The power grid compromise has become known as the first-of-its-kind cyber warfare attack affecting civilians.",

It operates by encrypting data for the purpose of making ransom demands for the decryption tools. In other words, files affected by BlackMatter are rendered inaccessible, and victims are asked to pay - to recover access to their data.\r\n\r\nDuring the encryption process, files are appended with an extension consisting of a random character string. For example, a file initially named \"1.jpg\" would appear as something similar to \"1.jpg.k5RO9fVOl\". After this process is complete, the ransomware changes the desktop wallpaper and created a ransom note - \"[random_string].README.txt\" (e.g., k5RO9fVOl.README.txt).",

The commands are indexed by 16-bit integers, starting with the index 0x2009 and going incrementally up to 0x2057, with some indicis being skipped. \r\nIt uses various parameter names in its HTTP POST requests, mostly associated with web servers running bulletin board systems, like bbs, article, boardid, s_board, page, idx_num, etc.\r\nIt contains specific RTTI symbols like \".?AVCHTTP_Protocol@@\", \".?AVCFileRW@@\" or \".?AVCSinSocket@@\".\r\nBLINDINGCAN RAT is a flagship payload deployed in many Lazarus attacks, especially in the Operation DreamJob campaigns happening in 2020-2022.",

      "description": "Oyster is a backdoor malware written in C++ that first appeared in July 2023. It allows for remote sessions, supporting tasks such as file transfer and command-line processing. This malware has been used by numerous threat actors as a tool to facilitate ransomware intrusions. The distribution of Oyster has likely occurred through various methods, as suggested by the build identifiers found in examined samples. Additionally, Oyster is capable of collecting basic system data and communicates with a command-and-control (C2) server. It can execute commands via cmd.exe and run additional files.\r\n\r\nIn August 2024, a new version of Oyster was discovered that featured a new command-and-control (C2) communication protocol format. This 2024 version contained plaintext strings and lacked code obfuscation, suggesting it was still in development. In contrast to the 2024 version, the new 2025 Oyster version does not send C2 messages in plaintext, instead reintroducing the substitution cipher that was present in earlier versions of Oyster.",

      "description": "Brute Ratel C4 (BRC4) is a commercial framework for red-teaming and adversarial attack simulation, which made its first appearance in December 2020. It was specifically designed to evade detection by endpoint detection and response (EDR) and antivirus (AV) capabilities. BRC4 allows operators to deploy a backdoor agent known as Badger (aka BOLDBADGER) within a target environment.\r\nThis agent enables arbitrary command execution, facilitating lateral movement, privilege escalation, and the establishment of additional persistence avenues. The Badger backdoor agent can communicate with a remote server via DNS over HTTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, and TCP, using custom encrypted channels. It supports a variety of backdoor commands including shell command execution, file transfers, file execution, and credential harvesting. Additionally, the Badger agent can perform tasks such as port scanning, screenshot capturing, and keystroke logging. Notably, in September 2022, a cracked version of Brute Ratel C4 was leaked in the cybercriminal underground, leading to its use by threat actors.",

CargoBay is likely based on source code taken from 'Black Hat Rust' GitHub project (https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust). CargoBay is usually distributed via phishing emails, and the malware binaries may be disguised as legitimate applications. Upon execution, the malware starts by performing environmental checks such as checking its execution path and the configured system language. If the tests pass, then the malware proceeds to gather basic system information and register with its C2 via HTTP from which it receives JSON-formatted jobs to carry out. CargoBay can execute commands via the command line and downloading additional malware binaries.",

It includes backdoors, loaders, orchestrators, C2 communicators, audio recorders, keyloggers, screen and webcam grabbers, documents and cryptography key stealers, and even its own file indexer for the victim’s machine. We discovered up to 80 malicious modules stored in its encrypted Virtual File System, one of the highest numbers of plugins they have ever seen for an APT toolset.",

The most important functionality is to load a received buffer, either as a DLL via the MemoryModule implementation, or as a shellcode.\r\n\r\nIt uses AES for encryption and decryption of network traffic. It usually sends the following information back to its C&C server: computer name, product name and the list of running processes. Typically, it uses two hardcoded parameter names for its initial HTTP POST requests: gametype and type (alternatively: type and code).\r\n\r\nThe CLOUDBURST payload is disguised as mscoree.dll and is side-loaded via a legitimate Windows binary PresentationHost.exe with the argument -embeddingObject. It comes either as a trojanized plugin project for Notepad++ (usually FingerText by erinata), or as a standalone DLL loaded by a dropper, which is a trojanized plugin project as well (usually NppyPlugin by Jari Pennanen).\r\n\r\nThe CLOUDBURST malware was used in Operation DreamJob attacks against an aerospace company and a network running Microsoft Intune software in Q2-Q3 2022.",

      "description": "Cobalt Strike is a paid penetration testing product that allows an attacker to deploy an agent named 'Beacon' on the victim machine. Beacon includes a wealth of functionality to the attacker, including, but not limited to command execution, key logging, file transfer, SOCKS proxying, privilege escalation, mimikatz, port scanning and lateral movement. Beacon is in-memory/file-less, in that it consists of stageless or multi-stage shellcode that once loaded by exploiting a vulnerability or executing a shellcode loader, will reflectively load itself into the memory of a process without touching the disk. It supports C2 and staging over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB named pipes as well as forward and reverse TCP; Beacons can be daisy-chained. Cobalt Strike comes with a toolkit for developing shellcode loaders, called Artifact Kit.\r\n\r\nThe Beacon implant has become popular amongst targeted attackers and criminal users as it is well written, stable, and highly customizable.",

The purpose of the malware is to download and execute second-stage payloads while evading detection by endpoint-based security products. The malware uses numerous techniques to bypass security solutions, including a specialized packer called Armoury that utilizes the GPU, call stack spoofing, sleep obfuscation, and the use of Windows fibers. It also contains a backup DGA and is capable of deploying Rhadamanthys shellcode. ThreatLabz has observed CoffeeLoader being distributed via SmokeLoader, and both malware families share some behavioral similarities.",

The payload was encrypted using RC4 and added to the cryptostub as a resource. The encryption key itself was stored inside the resource as well. Upon start the cryptostub would extract the key, decrypt the payload and perform a selfinjection using the now decrypted payload.\r\nNote: The packed sample provided contains some harmless payload, while the unpacked sample is the bare cryptostub without a payload.",

Like many other stealers its main purpose is to steal credentials and information from web browsers, in addition to stealing cryptocurrency wallets, FTP credentials, various files and information about the system such as OS version, system language, processor type and clipboard data. When the infostealer collects information that will be stolen, it saves the information in the ZIP form instead of files in the memory. Doing so will allow the malware to bypass detection as there are no traces of files and execution. The only known method of delivering stolen information to cybercriminals is by sending a ZIP archive to the hardcoded command and control (C2) server.",

As the initial connection, the client exchanges the keys with the server via the Diffie–Hellman key agreement protocol for the elliptic curve secp521r1. The client generates a random 32-bytes long private key, and the server responds with its public key in a buffer starting with the wide character \"0\".\r\n\r\nNext, the clients sends the current local time, and the server responds with a buffer containing multiple values separated with the pipe symbol. The typical values are the encrypted payload, the export to execute, and the MD5 hash of the decrypted DLL to verify the authenticity of the payload. \r\n\r\nThere are variants of ComeBacker without statically linked OpenSSL. In that case, the key exchange is omitted and AES CBC is replaced with HC-256.\r\n",

It was first observed in 2020 and it is thought to be led by a Russia-based cybercrime group that goes under the Wizard Spider pseudonym.

Typically, cyber criminals use RATs to steal sensitive, confidential information, infect systems with other malware, and so on. In any case, no RAT is harmless and should be uninstalled immediately.",

The payload is deployed using load-order hijacking with a benign Windows Defender executable. Stage 1 has only beacon+download functionality, made to look like a PNG file. Additional analysis by Kaspersky found 8 campaigns over 2019 and no activity prior to January 2019, DADJOKE is attributed with medium confidence to APT40.",

The social engineering in the low-volume DanaBot campaigns we have observed so far has been well-crafted, again pointing to a renewed focus on “quality over quantity” in email-based threats. DanaBot’s modular nature enables it to download additional components, increasing the flexibility and robust stealing and remote monitoring capabilities of this banker. ",

While it appears to primarily deliver commodity malware, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers identified DarkTortilla samples delivering targeted payloads such as Cobalt Strike and Metasploit. It can also deliver \"addon packages\" such as additional malicious payloads, benign decoy documents, and executables. It features robust anti-analysis and anti-tamper controls that can make detection, analysis, and eradication challenging.\r\n\r\nFrom January 2021 through May 2022, an average of 93 unique DarkTortilla samples per week were uploaded to the VirusTotal analysis service. Code similarities suggest possible links between DarkTortilla and other malware: a crypter operated by the RATs Crew threat group, which was active between 2008 and 2012, and the Gameloader malware that emerged in 2021.",

In July 2024, a malware campaign was observed distributing DarkVision_RAT using PureCrypter as a loader. This RAT communicates with its command and control server through a custom network protocol via sockets. It also employs evasion and privilege escalation techniques such as DLL hijacking, self-elevation, and process injection.

Therefore, cyber criminals who are willing to use DiamondFox do not necessarily require any technical knowledge to perform their attacks.\r\n\r\nOnce purchased, this malware can be used to log keystrokes, steal credentials (e.g., usernames, email addresses, passwords), hijack cryptocurrency wallets, perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and to carry out other malicious tasks.\r\n\r\nDiamondFox allows cyber criminals to choose which plug-ins to keep activated and see infection statistics in real-time.",

      "description": "OxCERT blog describes Dridex as \"an evasive, information-stealing malware variant; its goal is to acquire as many credentials as possible and return them via an encrypted tunnel to a Command-and-Control (C&C) server. These C&C servers are numerous and scattered all over the Internet, if the malware cannot reach one server it will try another. For this reason, network-based measures such as blocking the C&C IPs is effective only in the short-term.\"\r\nAccording to MalwareBytes, \"Dridex uses an older tactic of infection by attaching a Word document that utilizes macros to install malware. However, once new versions of Microsoft Office came out and users generally updated, such a threat subsided because it was no longer simple to infect a user with this method.\"\r\nIBM X-Force discovered \"a new version of the Dridex banking Trojan that takes advantage of a code injection technique called AtomBombing to infect systems. AtomBombing is a technique for injecting malicious code into the 'atom tables' that almost all versions of Windows uses to store certain application data. It is a variation of typical code injection attacks that take advantage of input validation errors to insert and to execute malicious code in a legitimate process or application. Dridex v4 is the first malware that uses the AtomBombing process to try and infect systems.\"",

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA), detected a new malware named \"DUSTMAN\" that was detonated on December 29, 2019. Based on analyzed evidence and artifacts found on machines in a victim’s network that were not wiped by the malware. NCSC assess that the threat actor behind the attack had some kind of urgency on executing the files on the date of the attack due to multiple OPSEC failures observed on the infected network. NCSC is calling the malware used in this attack \"DUSTMAN\" after the filename and string embedded in the malware. \"DUSTMAN\" can be considered as a new variant of \"ZeroCleare\" malware,\r\npublished in December 2019.",

It will attempt to establish TCP sessions with the source IP address and the destination IP address. If a connection is made to both the source and destination IPs, this malicious utility will implement a custom protocol, which will allow traffic to rapidly and efficiently be tunneled between two machines. If necessary, the malware can authenticate with a proxy to be able to reach the destination IP address. A configured proxy server is not required for this utility.",

From malware analysts it has been classified into epochs depending on command and control, payloads, and delivery solutions which change over time.\r\nEmotet had been taken down by authorities in January 2021, though it appears to have sprung back to life in November 2021.",

It is generally dropped by the MiniDuke backdoor, but ESET also have seen the operators dropping FatDuke using lateral movement tools such as PsExec.The operators regularly repack this malware in order to evade detections. The most recent sample of FatDuke that ESET have seen was compiled on May 24, 2019. They have seen them trying to regain control of a machine multiple times in a few days, each time with  a different sample. Their packer, described in a later section, adds a lot of code, leading to large binaries. While the effective code should not be larger than 1MB, ESET have seen one sample weighing in at 13MB, hence our name for this backdoor component: FatDuke.",

It uses back-connect socket secure internet protocol (SOCKS5) connections and is available for rent for US $100 per month. In February 2024, the author of Lumma Stealer released an update introducing the integration of proxying capabilities. This feature, developed in partnership with GhostSocks, allows the use of infected hosts as SOCKS5 proxies and is available to all subscribers who purchase the \"Professional\" or higher tier plan. This integration allows Lumma Stealer users to establish a network of residential IP addresses for various purposes, including credential checking, spam distribution, or as general-purpose proxies.",

This first version of Gozi was developed by Nikita Kurmin, and he borrowed code from Ursnif aka Snifula, a spyware developed by Alexey Ivanov around 2000, and some other kits. Gozi v1.0 thus had a formgrabber module and often is classified as Ursnif aka Snifula.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, the source code of a particular Gozi CRM dll version was leaked, which led to Vawtrak/Neverquest (in combination with Pony) via Gozi Prinimalka (a slightly modified Gozi v1.0) and Gozi v2.0 (aka 'Gozi ISFB' aka 'ISFB' aka Pandemyia).

After the cards are first scanned, the personal account number (PAN) and accompanying data sit in the point-of-sale system’s memory unencrypted while the system determines where to send it for authorization. \r\nMasked as the LogMein software, the GratefulPOS malware appears to have emerged during the fall 2017 shopping season with low detection ratio according to some of the earliest detections displayed on VirusTotal. The first sample was upload in November 2017.

      "description": "Havex is a remote access trojan (RAT) that was discovered in 2013 as part of a widespread espionage campaign targeting industrial control systems (ICS) used across numerous industries and attributed to a hacking group referred to as \"Dragonfly\" and \"Energetic Bear\". Havex is estimated to have impacted thousands of infrastructure sites, a majority of which were located in Europe and the United States. Within the energy sector, Havex specifically targeted energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and industrial equipment providers. Havex also impacted organizations in the aviation, defense, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, Havex scanned the infected system to locate any Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) or ICS devices on the network and sent the data back to command and control servers. To do so, the malware leveraged the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard, which is a universal communication protocol used by ICS components across many industries that facilitates open connectivity and vendor equipment interoperability. Havex used the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to connect to OPC servers inside of an ICS network and collect information such as CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.\r\n\r\nHavex was an intelligence-collection tool used for espionage and not for the disruption or destruction of industrial systems. However, the data collected by Havex would have aided efforts to design and develop attacks against specific targets or industries.",

      "description": "First released in October 2022, the Havoc C2 Framework is a flexible post-exploitation framework written in Golang, C++, and Qt, with agents called 'Demons' written in C and ASM, created by @C5pider. Designed to support red team engagements and adversary emulation, it offers a robust set of capabilities tailored for offensive security operations. The framework, which is under active development, utilizes HTTP(s) and SMB as communication protocols for its implants. Havoc can generate implants, known as Demons, in several formats including EXE, DLL, and Shellcode. A notable feature of Havoc is its ability to bypass EDR by employing advanced evasion techniques such as sleep obfuscation, return address stack spoofing, and indirect syscalls. This capability enhances its effectiveness in evading detection and circumventing security measures.",

      "description": "According to Proofpoint, IcedID (aka BokBot) is a malware originally classified as a banking malware and was first observed in 2017. It also acts as a loader for other malware, including ransomware.  The well-known IcedID version consists of an initial loader which contacts a Loader C2 server, downloads the standard DLL Loader, which then delivers the standard IcedID Bot. IcedID is developed and operated by the actor named LUNAR SPIDER.\r\n\r\nAs previously published, historically there has been just one version of IcedID that has remained constant since 2017.\r\n* In November 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed the first new variant of IcedID Proofpoint dubbed 'IcedID Lite' distributed as a follow-on payload in a TA542 Emotet campaign. It was dropped by the Emotet malware soon after the actor returned to the e-crime landscape after a nearly four-month break.\r\n* The IcedID Lite Loader observed in November 2022 contains a static URL to download a 'Bot Pack' file with a static name (botpack.dat) which results in the IcedID Lite DLL Loader, and then delivers the Forked version of IcedID Bot, leaving out the webinjects and backconnect functionality that would typically be used for banking fraud.\r\n* Starting in February 2023, Proofpoint observed the new Forked variant of IcedID. This variant was distributed by TA581 and one unattributed threat activity cluster which acted as initial access facilitators. The campaigns used a variety of email attachments such as Microsoft OneNote attachments and somewhat rare to see .URL attachments, which led to the Forked variant of IcedID.",

They were feature-rich backdoors and turned the affected computer into a video camera, letting the attackers to spy the victim. \r\nThe malicious actors behind this malware were active at least since 2013 in highly targeted campaigns with only a few dozen compromised computers in Ukraine and Russia. The wrapper DLL posed as a legitimate mpr.dll library and was placed in the same folder as explorer.exe, which made it being loaded during the Windows startup into the Windows Explorer process instead of the legitimate library.\r\nMalware came in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, which made this persistence technique functional on both architectures.\r\n\r\nThe smaller of the modules, RC2FM, contained a backdoor with fifteen supported commands indexed by numbers. The commands could perform simple changes on the system and spying features like capturing sounds, taking screenshots or monitoring all fixed and removable drives.\r\n\r\nThe second module, RC2CL, offered features for collecting as much data about the infected computer as possible, rather than for making system changes. The module supported up to 84 commands such as file system operations, file execution, registry key manipulation, remote shell activation, wireless network scanning, listing of installed software etc. Though the backdoor was capable of interfering with the system (e.g. to log off a user, terminate a process or shut down the system), it mostly provided passive operations. Whenever possible, it tried to hide its activities by restoring the original file access time or safe-deleting its traces. ",

      "description": "2006 Gozi v1.0, Gozi CRM, CRM, Papras\r\n2010 Gozi v2.0, Gozi ISFB, ISFB, Pandemyia(*)\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, the source code of a particular Gozi CRM dll version was leaked. This led to two main branches: one became known as Gozi Prinimalka, which was merge with Pony and became Vawtrak/Neverquest.\r\n\r\nThe other branch became known as Gozi ISFB, or ISFB in short. Webinject functionality was added to this version.\r\n\r\nThere is one panel which often was used in combination with ISFB: IAP. The panel's login page comes with the title 'Login - IAP'. The body contains 'AUTHORIZATION', 'Name:', 'Password:' and a single button 'Sign in' in a minimal design. Often, the panel is directly accessible by entering the C2 IP address in a browser. But there are ISFB versions which are not directly using IAP. The bot accesses a gate, which is called the 'Dreambot' gate. See win.dreambot for further information.\r\n\r\nISFB often was protected by Rovnix. This led to a further complication in the naming scheme - many companies started to call ISFB Rovnix. Because the signatures started to look for Rovnix, other trojans protected by Rovnix (in particular ReactorBot and Rerdom) sometimes got wrongly labelled.\r\n\r\nIn April 2016 a combination of Gozi ISFB and Nymaim was detected. This breed became known as GozNym. The merge uses a shellcode-like version of Gozi ISFB, that needs Nymaim to run. The C2 communication is performed by Nymaim.\r\n\r\nSee win.gozi for additional historical information.",

It can also bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication. Kronos employs advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection by antivirus software and actively updates itself to evade security patches. It has been known to target a wide range of banking systems and has affected numerous organizations worldwide.

Although the infection strategy is not new, the final payload dropped – which they named LATENTBOT – caught attention since it implements several layers of obfuscation, a unique exfiltration mechanism, and has been very successful at infecting multiple organizations.",

Lightless is able to execute them discreetly within the RAT itself, rather than being executed visibly in the system console. This provides stealthiness, both in evading real-time monitoring solutions like EDRs, and postmortem digital forensic tools.\r\n\r\nLightlessCan use RC6 for decryption of its configuration, and also for encryption and decryption of network traffic.\r\n",

      "description": "\"Loki Bot is a commodity malware sold on underground sites which is designed to steal private data from infected machines, and then submit that info to a command and control host via HTTP POST. This private data includes stored passwords, login credential information from Web browsers, and a variety of cryptocurrency wallets.\" - PhishMe\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot employs function hashing to obfuscate the libraries utilized. While not all functions are hashed, a vast majority of them are.\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot accepts a single argument/switch of ‘-u’ that simply delays execution (sleeps) for 10 seconds. This is used when Loki-Bot is upgrading itself.\r\n\r\nThe Mutex generated is the result of MD5 hashing the Machine GUID and trimming to 24-characters. For example: “B7E1C2CC98066B250DDB2123“.\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot creates a hidden folder within the %APPDATA% directory whose name is supplied by the 8th thru 13th characters of the Mutex. For example: “%APPDATA%\\ C98066\\”.\r\n\r\nThere can be four files within the hidden %APPDATA% directory at any given time: “.exe,” “.lck,” “.hdb” and “.kdb.” They will be named after characters 13 thru 18 of the Mutex. For example: “6B250D.” Below is the explanation of their purpose:\r\n\r\nFILE EXTENSION\tFILE DESCRIPTION\r\n.exe\tA copy of the malware that will execute every time the user account is logged into\r\n.lck\tA lock file created when either decrypting Windows Credentials or Keylogging to prevent resource conflicts\r\n.hdb\tA database of hashes for data that has already been exfiltrated to the C2 server\r\n.kdb\tA database of keylogger data that has yet to be sent to the C2 server\r\n\r\nIf the user is privileged, Loki-Bot sets up persistence within the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. If not, it sets up persistence under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.\r\n\r\nThe first packet transmitted by Loki-Bot contains application data.\r\n\r\nThe second packet transmitted by Loki-Bot contains decrypted Windows credentials.\r\n\r\nThe third packet transmitted by Loki-Bot is the malware requesting C2 commands from the C2 server. By default, Loki-Bot will send this request out every 10 minutes after the initial packet it sent.\r\n\r\nCommunications to the C2 server from the compromised host contain information about the user and system including the username, hostname, domain, screen resolution, privilege level, system architecture, and Operating System.\r\n\r\nThe first WORD of the HTTP Payload represents the Loki-Bot version.\r\n\r\nThe second WORD of the HTTP Payload is the Payload Type. Below is the table of identified payload types:\r\n\r\nBYTE\tPAYLOAD TYPE\r\n0x26\tStolen Cryptocurrency Wallet\r\n0x27\tStolen Application Data\r\n0x28\tGet C2 Commands from C2 Server\r\n0x29\tStolen File\r\n0x2A\tPOS (Point of Sale?)\r\n0x2B\tKeylogger Data\r\n0x2C\tScreenshot\r\n\r\nThe 11th byte of the HTTP Payload begins the Binary ID. This might be useful in tracking campaigns or specific threat actors. This value value is typically “ckav.ru”. If you come across a Binary ID that is different from this, take note!\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot encrypts both the URL and the registry key used for persistence using Triple DES encryption.\r\n\r\nThe Content-Key HTTP Header value is the result of hashing the HTTP Header values that precede it. This is likely used as a protection against researchers who wish to poke and prod at Loki-Bot’s C2 infrastructure.\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot can accept the following instructions from the C2 Server:\r\n\r\nBYTE\tINSTRUCTION DESCRIPTION\r\n0x00\tDownload EXE & Execute\r\n0x01\tDownload DLL & Load #1\r\n0x02\tDownload DLL & Load #2\r\n0x08\tDelete HDB File\r\n0x09\tStart Keylogger\r\n0x0A\tMine & Steal Data\r\n0x0E\tExit Loki-Bot\r\n0x0F\tUpgrade Loki-Bot\r\n0x10\tChange C2 Polling Frequency\r\n0x11\tDelete Executables & Exit\r\n\r\nSuricata Signatures\r\nRULE SID\tRULE NAME\r\n2024311\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Cryptocurrency Wallet Exfiltration Detected\r\n2024312\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Application/Credential Data Exfiltration Detected M1\r\n2024313\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Request for C2 Commands Detected M1\r\n2024314\tET TROJAN Loki Bot File Exfiltration Detected\r\n2024315\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Keylogger Data Exfiltration Detected M1\r\n2024316\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Screenshot Exfiltration Detected\r\n2024317\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Application/Credential Data Exfiltration Detected M2\r\n2024318\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Request for C2 Commands Detected M2\r\n2024319\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Keylogger Data Exfiltration Detected M2",

      "description": "Lumma Stealer (aka LummaC2 Stealer) is an information stealer written in C language that has been available through a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model on Russian-speaking forums since at least August 2022. It is believed to have been developed by the threat actor \"Shamel\", who goes by the alias \"Lumma\". Lumma Stealer primarily targets cryptocurrency wallets and two-factor authentication (2FA) browser extensions, before ultimately stealing sensitive information from the victim's machine. Once the targeted data is obtained, it is exfiltrated to a C2 server via HTTP POST requests using the user agent \"TeslaBrowser/5.5\".\" The stealer also features a non-resident loader that is capable of delivering additional payloads via EXE, DLL, and PowerShell.",

      "description": "According to ESET, Machete’s dropper is a RAR SFX executable. Three py2exe components are dropped: GoogleCrash.exe, Chrome.exe and GoogleUpdate.exe. A single configuration file, jer.dll, is dropped, and it contains base64‑encoded text that corresponds to AES‑encrypted strings.\r\nGoogleCrash.exe is the main component of the malware. It schedules execution of the other two components and creates Windows Task Scheduler tasks to achieve persistence.\r\nRegarding the geolocation of victims, Chrome.exe collects data about nearby Wi-Fi networks and sends it to the Mozilla Location Service API. In short, this application provides geolocation coordinates when it’s given other sources of data such as Bluetooth beacons, cell towers or Wi-Fi access points. Then the malware takes latitude and longitude coordinates to build a Google Maps URL.\r\nThe GoogleUpdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the remote C&C server. The configuration to set the connection is read from the jer.dll file: domain name, username and password. The principal means of communication for Machete is via FTP, although HTTP communication was implemented as a fallback in 2019.",

      "description": "According to Talos, MagicRAT is programmed in C++ programming language and uses the Qt Framework by statically linking it to the RAT on 32- and 64-bit versions. The Qt Framework is a programming library for developing graphical user interfaces, of which this RAT has none. Talos thinks that the objective was to increase the complexity of the code, thus making human analysis harder. On the other hand, since there are very few examples (if any) of malware programmed with Qt Framework, this also makes machine learning and heuristic analysis detection less reliable. The RAT uses the Qt classes throughout its entire code. The configuration is dynamically stored in a QSettings class eventually being saved to disk, a typical functionality provided by that class.\r\n\r\nMagicRAT provides the operator with a remote shell on the victim's system for arbitrary command execution, along with the ability to rename, move and delete files on the endpoint. The operator can determine the timing for the implant to sleep, change the C2 URLs and delete the implant from the infected system.",

However, it has remained active since then, continually updating its tactics by employing new obfuscation techniques and methods of evasion. In April 2022, Magniber gained notoriety for disguising itself as a Windows update file to lure victims into installing it. It then began spreading via JavaScript in September 2022.",

Matanbuchus has been observed being used in attacks against US universities and high schools, as well as a Belgian high-tech organization.",

Moisha disables real-time protection in Microsoft Defender and removes shadow copies using PowerShell and Vssadmin. It encrypts files on the system using RSA and AES encryption algorithms and places a ransom note in the affected directory. The note instructs victims to contact the attackers via a Moisha ID on TOX Messenger to negotiate the ransom. Additionally, Moisha spreads to other machines on the network and self-deletes using PowerShell command line.",

MountLocker does however use a cryptographically insecure method for key generation that may be prone to attack.",

      "description": "NetfilterRootkit is a WFP application layer enforcement callout driver which is signed by Microsoft via the Windows Hardware Compatibility program. It was first discovered by Karsten Hahn. His team submitted the malware to Microsoft, which allowed Microsoft to start an investigation.\r\n\r\nAfter Karsten Hahn published tweets and an article about the rootkit, Microsoft quickly responded with their own article. Their investigation revealed Chinese gamers as targets of the malware. The rootkit redirects traffic to the threat actor's IP. The threat actor can use the driver to spoof their geo-location to cheat, but it also allows account compromise of targeted players.\r\n\r\nWhile this particular rootkit is not significant anymore, similar rootkits have been created since that are also signed by Microsoft via the Windows Hardware Compatibility program.

      "description": "Ntospy is a credential stealer leveraging a well-established technique of abusing the Windows Network Provider interface, a method documented as early as 2004 and exemplified by tools like NPPSpy. Posing as a legitimate Network Provider DLL, Ntospy injects itself into the Windows authentication process, hijacking login attempts to harvest user credentials. It achieves this by registering a malicious Network Provider, typically named \"credman,\" which intercepts authentication requests and redirects them to it malicious DLL. \r\n\r\nInstead of immediately exfiltrating the stolen data, Ntospy employs a form of local storage, writing the captured credentials in cleartext to files disguised as harmless Microsoft Update packages using the .msu file extension. These files are often planted in system directories with believable names like \"c:/programdata/package cache/windows10.0-kb5009543-x64.msu,\" further masking their malicious purpose.\r\n\r\nAdding to its stealth, Ntospy incorporates obfuscation techniques to evade detection. This includes using seemingly innocuous filenames for its DLL, often mimicking critical system files like \"ntoskrnl.dll\" to blend in. Some variants even go a step further by encrypting the credential storage file path within the DLL, requiring analysis and decryption to uncover its full functionality.\r\n",

After execution, this malware terminates a number of processes such as database processes, likely to allow access to any files that these programs may have held open. Ordinypt will avoid wiping certain files and folders in order to prevent the infected machine from becoming unusable. Affected files are overwritten with null character and receive a random 5 character file extension. Finally, shadow copies are removed and Windows startup repair is disabled to complicate recovery of data from the affected system. The desktop background is changed and a ransom note is dropped for the victim. A C2 check-in occurs to keep track of the file extension used on that specific machine, as well as which BitCoin address was randomly provided for payment to the victim (drawn from a long list stored in the ransomware configuration).

It was first detected in February 2023 and was distributed by TA581 along with an unattributed threat activity cluster that facilitated initial access. In this version, the configuration file is no longer encrypted using a simple XOR algorithm with a 64-byte key. Instead, it uses a custom algorithm previously used by the Standard core loader. This algorithm decrypts DLL strings that are needed to resolve handles to the necessary DLLs later on. The strings are decrypted using an algorithm that splits the data into DWORDs and XORs it against a random key. The main objective of PHOTOFORK remains the same as GZIPLOADER, i.e. to deliver an encrypted bot and core DLL loader (forked) that loads the Forked ICEDID bot into memory using a custom PE format.",

Despite being in the early stages of development, it already demonstrates advanced techniques in evasion, injection, and anti-analysis. Notably, the loader component incorporates an array of sophisticated anti-debugging and anti-VM measures inspired by the open-source Al-Khaser project, while leveraging steganography to conceal its payload. Additionally, Pikabot utilizes a proprietary C2 framework and supports a diverse range of commands, encompassing host enumeration and advanced secondary payload injection options.",

      "description": "PostNapTea aka SIGNBT is an HTTP(S) RAT that is written as a complex object-oriented project.\r\n\r\nIn 2022-2023, it was deployed against targets like a newspaper organization, agriculture-related entity or a software vendor. The initial access was usually achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in widely-used software in South Korea.\r\n\r\nIt collects various information about the victim’s computer, such as computer name, product name, OS details, system uptime, CPU information, system locale, time zone, network status, and malware configuration. \r\n\r\nPostNapTea uses AES for encryption and decryption ot network traffic. There is a constant prefix SIGNBT occuring in its HTTP POST requests. The prefix is concatenated with 2 characters that identify the communication stage:\r\n• LG: logging into the C&C server\r\n• KE: acknowledging the succesful login to the C&C\r\n• FI: sending the status of a failed operation \r\n• SR: sending the status of a successful operation\r\n• GC: getting the next command\r\n\r\nThere are five classes that represent command groups:\r\n• CCButton: for file manipulation and screen capturing\r\n• CCBitmap: for network commands, implementing functionality of Windows commands often abused by attackers, like sc, reg, arp, net, ver, wmic, ping, whoami, netstat, tracert, lookup, ipconfig,\r\nsysteminfo, and netsh advfirewall. \r\n• CCComboBox: for file system management\r\n• CCList: for process management\r\n• CCBrush: for control of the malware itself\r\n\r\nIt stores its configuration in JSON format. It resolves the Windows APIs it requires during runtime, via the Fowler–Noll–Vo (FNV) hash function.\r\n\r\nIts internal name in the version-information resource is usually ppcsnap.dll or pconsnap.dll, which loosely inspired its code name.",

Most of the loaders bundle an embedded python runtime, python library modules in source/compiled/native forms as well as a flexible configuration. They bootstrap a python runtime environment mostly in-memory for the later stages of pupy to run in. Pupy can communicate using various transports, migrate into processes, load remote python code, python packages and python C-extensions from memory.",

According to one source, ransom amounts demanded as part of PwndLocker activity range from $175k USD to $650k USD depending on the size of the network. PwndLocker attempts to disable a variety of Windows services so that their data can be encrypted. Various processes will also be targeted, such as web browsers and software related to security, backups, and databases. Shadow copies are cleared by the ransomware, and encryption of files occurs once the system has been prepared in this way. Executable files and those that are likely to be important for the system to continue to function appear to be skipped by the ransomware, and a large number of folders mostly related to Microsoft Windows system files are also ignored. As of March 2020, encrypted files have been observed with the added extensions of .key and .pwnd. Ransom notes are dropped in folders where encrypted files are found and also on the user's desktop.",

Researchers identified only ten unique samples of the malware, indicating limited use, and three different variants, noted as versions 1, 2, and 3. The malware is unique as its final payload masquerades as a control panel link (CPL) file. The intended targets of this activity are unknown as of this writing; however, it was used concurrently with the SunOrcal malware and the same C2 infrastructure used by threat actors who primarily target based on the \"Five Poisons\" - five perceived threats deemed dangerous to, and working against the interests of, the Chinese government.",

A system inventory is also taken when running on a target machine, to include details such as the username, location data, hardware configuration, and information regarding installed security software.

      "description": "ReedBed, identified as a malware proxy backdoor, is suspected to be developed by QAKBOT devs, and was deployed by the threat actor Storm-1811 in campaigns observed during late October and early November 2024. These campaigns are typically initiated with email bombing, a tactic involving mass email distribution, followed by social engineering strategies where the actor impersonates help desk personnel to gain access to victim systems.\r\n\r\nUpon execution, ReedBed ensures single-instance operation via the mutex \"JhishdiI2Uhsvoc94keiojn7ns19m0do\" and hooks critical system APIs (NtCreateUserProcess, RtlExitUserProcess) for defense evasion, process interference, and anti-termination. It reads its Command and Control (C2) configuration, typically from the \"Software\\TitanPlus\" registry key, establishes a persistent SSL/TLS encrypted connection, and transmits an initial system information beacon. Subsequently, ReedBed enters its main operational loop, acting as a versatile network proxy based on C2 commands; this includes initiating outgoing TCP connections, relaying data bi-directionally, and establishing reverse SOCKS5 (with authentication) or direct TCP port mapping services via locally opened listening ports. If commanded or upon connection failure, it transitions into a restart/wait cycle guided by registry values, leveraging its hooked exit function to hinder termination before attempting to reconnect to the C2.",

The VBA installs a new root certificate and then forwards all traffic via TOR to the attacker controlled host in order to effectively MITM TLS traffic.",

The Reg Value used is the hardcoded value of 'lNOWZyAWVv' :\r\n  * SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\lNOWZyAWVv\r\n* Before exiting, REvil sets up its malicious executable to be deleted upon reboot by issuing a call to MoveFileExW and setting the destination to NULL and the flags to 4 (MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT).

      "description": "RiseLoader is a new malware loader family first observed in October 2024. It uses a custom TCP-based binary network protocol similar to, but distinct from, that used by the PrivateLoader and RisePro malware families. RiseLoader often drops other malware families, such as Vidar, Lumma Stealer, and XMRig, as secondary payloads. It collects information about installed applications and browser extensions, likely related to cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nKey technical characteristics of RiseLoader include:\r\n\r\nAnti-analysis Techniques: Samples are often packed with VMProtect and obfuscate strings related to malware analysis and debugging tools.\r\n\r\nBehavioural Analysis: Creates a mutex with a hardcoded prefix and randomly generated suffixes. Communicates with a C2 server over TCP using a custom protocol involving specific message types for tasks such as transferring system information, receiving payloads, and confirming execution. Downloads and executes payloads from URLs provided by the C2 server. Creates registry keys as infection markers.\r\n\r\nNetwork Communication: Uses a custom TCP-based protocol with message types like SEND_VICTIM_INFO, SYS_INFO, PAYLOADS, KEEPALIVE, and others. Data is XOR encoded using keys exchanged via a SET_XORKEYS message. The protocol includes a three-way handshake and mechanisms for re-establishing connections.\r\n\r\nSimilarities to RisePro/PrivateLoader: Shares similar network communication protocols and message structures with RisePro and PrivateLoader suggesting a potential link between their developers, though RiseLoader's protocol appears simplified. It currently lacks RisePro/PrivateLoader's information-stealing features but may be under development.\r\n\r\n",

This is used to disable anti-malware solutions, unpack and execute the main RAT DLL, and gain persistence. The trojan installs a Windows batch file dx.bat that attempts to kill the daumcleaner.exe task, a Korean security program. The file then attempts to remove itself. Once the second DLL is loaded into memory, the first DLL overwrites the IP address for the control server to change the address the trojan communicates with. The second DLL gathers information about the victim's system, including its operating system and driver and processor information. The RAT can log user keystrokes, copy the clipboard, delete files, compress files, clear event logs, shut down the machine, and more. The second DLL also uses several anti-bugging techniques.",

      "description": "F-Secure states that the Sality virus family has been circulating in the wild as early as 2003. Over the years, the malware has been developed and improved with the addition of new features, such as rootkit or backdoor functionality, and so on, keeping it an active and relevant threat despite the relative age of the malware.\r\n\r\nModern Sality variants also have the ability to communicate over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, allowing an attacker to control a botnet of Sality-infected machines. The combined resources of the Sality botnet may also be used by its controller(s) to perform other malicious actions, such as attacking routers.\r\n\r\nInfection\r\nSality viruses typically infect executable files on local, shared and removable drives. In earlier variants, the Sality virus simply added its own malicious code to the end of the infected (or host) file, a technique known as prepending. The viral code that Sality inserts is polymorphic, a form of complex code that is intended to make analysis more difficult.\r\n\r\nEarlier Sality variants were regarded as technically sophisticated in that they use an Entry Point Obscuration (EPO) technique to hide their presence on the system. This technique means that the virus inserts a command somewhere in the middle of an infected file's code, so that when the system is reading the file to execute it and comes to the command, it forces the system to 'jump' to the malware's code and execute that instead. This technique was used to make discovery and disinfection of the malicious code harder.\r\n\r\nPayload\r\nOnce installed on the computer system, Sality viruses usually also execute a malicious payload. The specific actions performed depend on the specific variant in question, but generally Sality viruses will attempt to terminate processes, particularly those related to security programs. The virus may also attempt to open connections to remote sites, download and run additional malicious files, and steal data from the infected machine.",

      "description": "Scavenger is a stealthy, two-stage malware family first observed in July 2025 following a targeted supply chain attack on the NPM ecosystem. The infection began with a phishing campaign that leveraged a typo-squatted domain (npnjs.com) to impersonate the legitimate NPM login page. The adversaries abused NPM's web-based login flow—akin to device code phishing—to trick a package maintainer into generating an automation access token, which does not expire and can bypass 2FA under certain configurations.\r\n\r\nWith the stolen credentials, the attackers injected malicious payloads into several trusted NPM packages, including eslint-config-prettier, by modifying their install scripts to execute a DLL loader. This first-stage loader, compiled in Visual Studio, performs anti-VM checks, dynamic API resolution using CRC32 hashing, indirect syscalls to bypass EDR, and string decryption routines. If the environment passes these checks, it executes a second-stage infostealer that targets browser data—particularly from Chromium—such as extension state, cached content, and visited URLs.\r\n\r\nThe malware communicates with its command and control infrastructure using libcurl and XXTEA-encrypted payloads over HTTP(S), implementing challenge-response integrity checks during session initialization. Development artifacts like a leftover PDB path and operational overlaps have linked Scavenger to other campaigns, including one involving an infected BeamNG game binary, further suggesting a broader and evolving threat infrastructure.",

Once ServHelper establishes remote desktop access, the malware contains functionality for the threat actor to 'hijack' legitimate user accounts or their web browser profiles and use them as they see fit. The 'downloader' variant is stripped of the tunneling and hijacking functionality and is used as a basic downloader.\"\r\n",

Besides capabilities typical for infostealers, SolarMarker has additional capabilities such as file transfer and execution of commands received from a C2 server.\r\n\r\nThe malware invests significant effort into defense evasion, which consists of techniques like signed files, huge files, impersonation of legitimate software installations and obfuscated PowerShell scripts.",

Early versions of the malware used a first-stage DLL that connected to a Telegram channel named 'SSLoad' to retrieve another URL. It then downloaded a compressed PE file using a hardcoded User-Agent (SSLoad/1.x) and Content-Type over HTTP. The downloaded file was then decompressed and executed directly in memory. The malware has since undergone several updates, including changes to the command-and-control (C2) communication and the supporting executables that load the malware. Recent versions of the malware bypass the first-stage DLL by loading SSLoad directly onto the victim's machine.",

StormKitty is also capable of collecting data from information repositories and performing file and directory discovery. For defense evasion, it employs techniques such as obfuscating files or information and checks for virtualization or sandbox environments to avoid detection. These capabilities enable StormKitty to maintain persistence and gather sensitive information from compromised systems.",

After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, it uses a DGA to generate specific subdomains for a set C&C domain. The backdoor retrieves and executes commands, that include the ability to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the machine, and disable system services. The C2 traffic to the malicious domains is designed to mimic normal SolarWinds API communications: Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol. The backdoor uses multiple obfuscated blocklists to identify forensic and anti-virus tools running as processes, services, and drivers. Multiple trojanzied updates were digitally signed from March - May 2020 and posted to the SolarWinds updates website.",

      "description": "Supper is a 64-bit Windows backdoor and tunnelling utility first observed in the wild in July 2024. This malware operates as both a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and a SOCKS5 proxy, offering threat actors persistent access to infected systems and the ability to route arbitrary traffic through victim environments.\r\n\r\nOnce executed, it establishes a TCP connection to its primary C2 endpoint, i.e. hardcoded in the file, over port 443. A fallback mechanism allows the malware to retrieve alternate C2 IP addresses from an encoded file, %temp%/s01bafg, ensuring resilience in case the primary server is unavailable. The malware supports up to 16,384 concurrent sessions over a single TCP connection, each uniquely identified via a 16-bit session ID. \r\n\r\nCommunication begins with an unencrypted 300-byte handshake payload that includes a static bot identifier (0x00691155), system metadata (hostname, domain, OS version, integrity level), and a fixed flag. Following this, all network traffic is wrapped in a 12-byte obfuscated header and an encrypted payload (8 bytes) which consists of two encrypted IP addresses. The header is transformed using two hardcoded XOR keys: 0x4d4d4d4d4d4d4d4d and 0x4d4d4d4d. Payload encryption is performed with a non-standard, stateful XOR cipher, where each byte of the message is encrypted based on a calculated offset and a cycling key (xored with 0x4d4d4d4d) derived from the header. \r\n\r\nIt supports a range of C2 commands, including remote shell execution, session teardown, SOCKS5 proxy operations, self-deletion, and dynamic updating of fallback IPs. When executing commands, Supper spawns a hidden cmd.exe instance and forwards command outputs back to the C2 server after encryption. As a proxy, it accepts operator-specified connection requests, establishes TCP sessions to external targets, and forwards data between the target and the attacker, all managed under the session multiplexing framework.\r\n\r\nIf instructed or if a C2 session fails, the malware can delete itself using cmd.exe or schtasks.exe, often masquerading the operation under the guise of a scheduled task named \"GoogleUpdateTask\". The file used to store fallback C2 IPs (%temp%/s01bafg) is updated by the malware using its encryption routine.\r\n\r\n",

Upon execution, it opens a file handle to log keystrokes and implements its keylogger using a SetWindowsHookExA hook. Keystrokes are written to the open log file, with special characters handled accordingly. Five distinct TerraLogger samples were identified, reflecting minor updates and active development.",

Once encryption is started, the ransomware will conduct a status report to an apparently hard-coded C2. Shadow copies are deleted and the Windows 10 repair environment is disabled by this ransomware. This malware also will terminate any running Outlook.exe process so that the mail files can be encrypted.

The third stage payload was created via the second stage payload, is interactively executed in the operation and exists in both x64 and x86 versions. Most of them use Internet Explorer or Google Chrome icons and corresponding file names to disguise themselves as legitimate internet browsers. The malware decrypts the embedded payload at runtime. It uses an embedded 16-byte XOR key to decrypt the base64 encoded payload. The decrypted payload is another portable executable file that runs in memory. Before getting decrypted with a hardcoded XOR key, the backdoor also checks for sandbox environment.\r\nThe backdoor has some code overlap with a know malware family PEBBLEDASH, attributed to Lazarus/LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.",

The malware then tricks them into entering their personal information, log-in credentials, etc in the legitimate-looking page.\r\n\r\nTinba may also display socially-engineered messages to lure or pressure the user into entering their information on the fake page; for example, a message may be shown which attempts to convince the victim that funds were accidentally deposited to his account and must be refunded immediately.",

The Trojan uses HTTP Server API to filter HTTPS packets at port 443 and parse commands. \r\nIt is also used by attackers to gather a target’s data, make lateral movements and create SOCKS tunnels to their C2 using the Earthworm tunneler.Given that the Trojan is an HTTPS server itself, the SOCKS tunnel is used for targets without an external IP, so the C2 is able to send commands.",

      "description": "unidentified_121 acts as a downloader and reflective PE loader, employing a dual-mode execution strategy based on its privilege level. When executed without administrative rights, it uniquely attempts to bypass User Account Control (UAC) by first patching its own Process Environment Block (PEB) in memory to masquerade as explorer.exe, and then leveraging a specific COM object ({3E5FC7F9-9A51-4367-9063-A120244FBEC7} with the Elevation:Administrator!new: moniker) to relaunch itself with elevated privileges. This initial stage focuses purely on achieving elevation and does not perform C2 communication or direct payload execution itself in the non-elevated state.\r\n\r\nOnce running with administrative privileges (either initially or after successful elevation), the malware establishes persistence by creating a Scheduled Task named \"BlaBlaAgu\" using COM, configuring it to run with the highest privileges and repeat every five minutes indefinitely. It actively evades defenses by using PowerShell commands (Add-MpPreference) to add Windows Defender exclusions for its own process and the user's profile directory, reinforcing these exclusions every 60 seconds via a separate thread. Its primary function in this elevated state is to act as a downloader, connecting to its Command and Control (C2) server over TCP port 33334 using a custom protocol encrypted with an RC4-like cipher and the hardcoded key \"ALB9SxZBzCqwPFnD\"; after a distinct 20-byte client handshake (RC4 Key + integer 444, followed by a 16-byte server response (RC4 Key) for validation), it downloads further encrypted PE payloads and executes them reflectively in its own memory space.",

As in many RATs from Lazarus arsenal, the commands are indexed by 32-bit integers. The lowest index is 0x3, followed by 0x10, which goes incrementally up to 0x26. Also, it can monitor newly connected drives and the number of logged-on users.\r\n\r\nIt has MPRD.dll as the internal DLL name, and a single export SamIInitialize.\r\n\r\nVyveva RAT was used in an attack against a freight logistics company in South Africa in June 2020.",

These designs include a sophisticated shellcode stager, the ability to load plugins on-the-fly, and overall evasiveness should the C2 server fail to respond with a valid session key.",

Some of these (python, bash) allow the malware to run on Linux systems.\r\n\r\nThe stealer has two execution methods:\r\n\r\n* Non-resident - the stealer auto-deletes itself after successful execution\r\n* Resident - the stealer beacons out to the C2 (possibly in the TOR network)\r\n\r\nWhiteSnake Stealer can gather system information, execute remote commands, spread through USB drives, and perform tasks like keylogging, file management, and webcam access.

This malware was initially spread through drivers bundled with USB-C hub adapters, which served as its primary distribution vector. Once executed, the backdoor self-replicates and to maintain persistence, it creates a Windows Registry Run key. Additionally, it uses a mutex named Synaptics2X to ensure that only one instance of the malware runs at a time. XRed includes several advanced features that enable remote control and data exfiltration. It can download additional payloads from hardcoded URLs embedded within its binary. The malware exfiltrates sensitive system information—such as the MAC address, username, and computer name—which is sent via SMTP to hardcoded email addresses. It also incorporates keylogging functionality through keyboard hooking techniques. Furthermore, XRed supports a variety of remote commands that allow the attacker to gain command prompt access, capture screenshots, list available disks and directories, download files from remote sources, and delete files from the infected system. XRed also exhibits worm-like behavior: It spreads through USB drives by creating an autorun.inf file. Additionally, the malware infects Excel files with macros (.xlsm) by injecting a malicious VBA macro into them. The malware uses a hardcoded dynamic DNS domain (xred.mooo.com) to communicate with its command and control server. This domain serves as an identifying feature of the malware. According to researchers at eSentire, linguistic evidence found in the malware's code suggests that the developer is a native Turkish speaker.",

      "description": "This family describes the (initially small) loader, which downloads Zeus OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nIn June 2016, a new loader was dubbed DEloader by Fortinet. It has some functions borrowed from Zeus 2.0.8.9 (e.g. the versioning, nrv2b, binstorage-labels), but more importantly, it downloaded a Zeus-like banking trojan (-> Zeus OpenSSL). Furthermore, the loader shared its versioning with the Zeus OpenSSL it downloaded.\r\nThe initial samples from May 2016 were small (17920 bytes). At some point, visualEncrypt/Decrypt was added, e.g. in v1.11.0.0 (September 2016) with size 27648 bytes. In January 2017 with v1.15.0.0, obfuscation was added, which blew the size up to roughly 80k, and the loader became known as Zloader aka Terdot. These changes may be related to the Moskalvzapoe Distribution Network, which started the distribution of it at the same time.\r\n\r\nPlease note that IBM X-Force decided to call win.zloader/win.zeus_openssl \"Zeus Sphinx\", after mentioning it as \"a new version of Zeus Sphinx\" in their initial post in August 2016. Malpedia thus lists the alias \"Zeus XSphinx\" for win.zeus_openssl - the X to refer to IBM X-Force.",

The malware may communicate with its command and control (C2) server over The Onion Router (Tor) network if configured to do so. The malware can download several plugins, some of which include features such as cryptocurrency mining and password recovery, from browsers and email software. Zyklon also provides a very efficient mechanism to monitor the spread and impact.",
