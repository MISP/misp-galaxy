The author of the initial loader webshell included legitimate and expected content that will be displayed if a visitor accesses the shell in a browser, likely to remain undetected. The code in the loader webshell includes obfuscated variable names and the embedded payload is encoded and encrypted. To interact with the loader webshell, the threat actor uses HTTP POST requests to the compromised server.\r\n\r\nThe secondary webshell, which we call the payload, is embedded within the loader in encrypted form and contains additional functionality that we will discuss in further detail. When the threat actor wants to interact with the remote server, they provide data that the loader will use to modify a decryption key embedded within the loader that will be in turn used to decrypt the embedded TwoFace payload. Commands supported by the payload are execution of programs, up-, download and deletion of files and capability to manipulate MAC timestamps.",

ALPHV is marketed as ALPHV on cybercrime forums, but is commonly called BlackCat by security researchers due to an icon of a black cat appearing on its leak site. ALPHV has been observed being deployed in ransomware attacks since November 18, 2021.\r\n\r\nALPHV can be configured to encrypt files using either the AES or ChaCha20 algorithms. In order to maximize the amount of ransomed data, ALPHV can delete volume shadow copies, stop processes and services, and stop virtual machines on ESXi servers. ALPHV can self-propagate by using PsExec to remote execute itself on other hosts on the local network.",

      "description": "MrBlack, first identified in May 2014 by Russian security firm Dr. Web, is a botnet that targets Linux OS and is designed to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In May 2015, Incapsula clients suffered a large-scale DDoS attack which the company attributed to network traffic generated by tens of thousands of small office/home office (SOHO) routers infected with MrBlack. This massive botnet spans over 109 countries, especially in Thailand and Brazil.\r\n\r\nMrBlack scans for and infects routers that have not had their default login credentials changed and that allow remote access to HTTP and SSH via port 80 and port 22, respectively. One of the most impacted router brands is Ubiquiti, a U.S.-based firm that provides bulk network hub solutions for internet service providers to lease to their customers. Once a vulnerable router is compromised and MrBlack is injected into the system, a remote server is contacted and system information from the device is transmitted. This allows the host server to receive commands in order to perform different types of DDoS attacks, download and execute files, and terminate processes.",

The ransom note was included solely as a text file, without any message on the screen—naturally, because it is a server and not an endpoint.\r\n\r\n2. Every victim is provided with a different, unique Bitcoin wallet—this could help the attackers avoid being traced.\r\n\r\n3. Once a victim is compromised, the malware requests a wallet address and a public RSA key from the command and control server (C&C) before file encryption.",

The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the Threat Actor’s Command-and-Control through TCP packets. When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (SMTP) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string. When the right sequence of packet is captured, it establishes a TCP reverse shell to the C2 server for further exploitation. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.\r\nThe malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named \"cd00r\".",

It shared the same C&C server as payloads from the 3CX incident around the same time.\r\n\r\nIt’s an object-oriented project, which does not run on Linux distributions without a graphical user interface, and decrypts its configuration from /home/%user%/.config/apdl.cf using 0x7E as the XOR key. It uses AES-GCM for encryption and decryption of its network traffic.\r\n\r\nIt supports basic commands that include operations on the victim’s filesystem, manipulation with its configuration, file exfiltration (via ZIP archives), and the download and execution of additional tools from the attacker’s arsenal. The commands are indexed by 16-bit integers, starting with the value 0x27C3.\r\n\r\nSimpleTea for Linux seems like an updated version of BadCall for Linux, rewritten from C to C++, as there are similarities in class names and function names between the two.",

Once a user has double-clicked the embedded image, the form executes a VB setup script.  The script writes files to the path %appdata%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\, then creates two task entries triggered to run daily.  The scripts are responsible for deobfuscating and executing the main JavaScript file mspromo.dot.  The file uses a character insertion obfuscation technique, making it appear to contain Chinese characters.  After deobfuscating the file, the main JavaScript is easily recognizable.  It contains a number of functions designed to drop files and execute scripts on a host system.  The SQLRat script is designed to make a direct SQL connection to a Microsoft database controlled by the attackers and execute the contents of various tables.",

      "description": "CoinThief was a malware package designed to steal Bitcoins from the victim, consisting of a binary patcher, browser extensions, and a backdoor component. \r\n\r\nIt was spreading in early 2014 from several different sources: \r\n- on Github (where the trojanized compiled binary didn’t match the displayed source code), o\r\n- on popular and trusted download sites line CNET's Download.com or MacUpdate.com, and \r\n- as cracked applications via torrents camouflaged as Bitcoin Ticker TTM, BitVanity, StealthBit, Litecoin Ticker, BBEdit, Pixelmator, Angry Birds and Delicious Library.\r\n\r\nThe patcher‘s role was to locate and modify legitimate versions of the Bitcoin-Qt wallet application. The analyzed malware samples targeted versions of Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.1, 0.8.0 and 0.8.5. The earlier patch modified Bitcoin-Qt adding malicious code that would send nearly all the victim’s Bitcoins to one of the hard-coded addresses belonging to the attacker. \r\n\r\nThe browser extensions targeted Chrome and Firefox and are disguised as a “Pop-up blocker”. The extensions monitored visited websites, download malicious JavaScripts and injected them into various Bitcoin-related websites (mostly Bitcoin exchanges and online wallet sites). The injected JS scripts were able to modify transactions to redirect Bitcoin transfers to an attacker’s address or simply harvest login credentials to the targeted online service.\r\n\r\nThe backdoor enabled the attacker to take full control over the victim’s computer:\r\n- collect information about the infected computer\r\n- execute arbitrary shell scripts on the target computer\r\n- upload an arbitrary file from the victim’s hard drive to a remote server\r\n- update itself to a newer version",

After launching the fake application, the main window of the fake cracking tool was displayed.\r\n\r\nThe file encryption process was launched after the misguided victim clicked 'Start'. Once executed, the ransomware generated a random 25-character string and set it as the key for RC4 encryption of all of the user's files. It then demanded ransom in Bitcoin, as instructed in the 'README!' .txt file copied all over the user's directories.\r\n\r\nDespite the instructions being quite thorough, Patcher lacked the functionality to communicate with any C&C server, and therefore made it impossible for its operators to decrypt affected files. The randomly generated encryption key was also too long to be guessed via a brute-force attack, leaving the encrypted data unrecoverable in a reasonable amount of time.",

Note: Laravel is an open source PHP framework and the Laravel .env file is often targeted for its various configuration data including AWS, SendGrid and Twilio. AndroxGh0st has multiple features to enable SMTP abuse including scanning, exploitation of exposed creds and APIs, and even deployment of webshells. For AWS specifically, the malware scans for and parses AWS keys but also has the ability to generate keys for brute force attacks.

It installs multiple files in the LocalAppData folder, each of which controls different functions including disabling bootup recovery options, deleting the ransomware installation file, encrypting data, and gaining administrator privileges. This variant also adds registry keys that disables various Windows function keys such as F1, F3, F4, F10, Alt, Num Lock, Ctrl, Enter, Escape, Shift, and Tab. Files encrypted by 7ev3n are labeled with a .R5A extension. It also locks victims out of Windows recovery options making it challenging to repair the damage done by 7ev3n.\"",

Despite the high amount of compromises, the information regarding identities, methodology, and underlying motivation behind these incidents still remains a mystery.

      "description": "A new form of ransomware named AlphaLocker that is built by cybercriminals for cybercriminals. Like all incarnations of Ransomware As A Service (RaaS), the AlphaLocker malware program can be purchased and launched by pretty much anyone who wants to get into the ransomware business. What makes AlphaLocker different from other forms of RaaS is its relatively cheap cost. The ransomware can be purchased for just $65 in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAlphaLocker, also known as Alpha Ransomware, is based on the EDA2 ransomware, an educational project open-sourced on GitHub last year by Turkish researcher Utku Sen. A Russian coder seems to have cloned this repository before it was taken down and used it to create his ransomware, a near-perfect clone of EDA2. The ransomware's author, is said to be paying a great deal of attention to updating the ransomware with new features, so it would always stay ahead of antivirus engines, and evade detection.\r\n\r\nAlphaLocker's encryption process starts when the ransomware contacts its C&C server. The server generates a public and a private key via the RSA-2048 algorithm, sending the public key to the user's computer and saving the private key to its server. On the infected computer, the ransomware generates an AES-256 key for each file it encrypts, and then encrypts this key with the public RSA key, and sent to the C&C server.\r\n\r\nTo decrypt their files, users have to get ahold of the private RSA key which can decrypt the AES-encrypted files found on their computers. Users have to pay around 0.35 Bitcoin (~$450) to get this key, packaged within a nice decrypter.",

As in many RATs from Lazarus arsenal, the commands are indexed by 32-bit integers, starting with values like 0x21A8B293, 0x23FAE29C or 0x91B93485.\r\n\r\nIt comes either as an EXE or as a DLL with the internal DLL name t_client_dll.dll. It may contain statically linked code from open-source libraries like Mbed TLS or zLib (version 1.0.1).\r\n\r\nAlreay RAT was observed in 2016-2017, running on networks of banks operating SWIFT Alliance software.",

This is because of a similar project, dubbed “Project Ares,” was previously uploaded to GitHub as a proof-of-concept (PoC) by the well-regarded user and red teamer “CerberSec.”\r\n\r\nThe loader mimics legitimate software to trick victims into executing malware with administrator rights on their machines. Additional features of the loader include:\r\n\r\n1. Written in C/C++\r\n2. Supports 64-bit payloads\r\n3. Makes it look like malware spawned by another process\r\n4. Prevents non-Microsoft signed binaries from being injected into malware\r\n5. Hides suspicious imported Windows APIs\r\n6. Leverages anti-analysis techniques to avoid reverse engineering\r\n\r\nFurthermore, It was observed that SystemBC, Amadey, and several Raccoon Stealers were directly installing AresLoader. To date, the AresLoader downloader has been seen delivering payloads like SystemBC, Lumma Stealer, StealC, Aurora Stealer, and Laplas Clipper.",

      "description": "Attor is a cyberespionage platform used in targeted attacks against diplomatic missions and governmental institutions since at least 2013. Its most interesting features are a complex modular architecture, elaborate network communications, and a unique plugin to fingerprint GSM/GPRS devices.\r\n\r\nAttor’s core lies in its dispatcher, which serves as a management unit for additional plugins which provide all of malware’s key capabilities. This allows the attackers to customize the platform on a per-victim basis. Plugins themselves are heavily synchronized. Network communication is based on Tor, aiming for anonymity and untraceability. \r\n\r\nThe most notable plugin can detect connected GSM/GPRS modems or mobile devices. Attor speaks to them directly using the AT command set, in order to collect sensitive information such as the IMEI, IMSI or MSISDN numbers, possibly identifying both the device and its subscriber. Other plugins provide persistence, an exfiltration channel, C&C communication and several further spying capabilities. The plugin responsible for capturing victim's screen targets social networks and blogging platforms, email services, office software, archiving utilities, file sharing and messaging services.",

As in many RATs from Lazarus arsenal, the commands are indexed by 32-bit integers. However, in this case the indicis are convertible into a meaningful ASCII representation, that even suggests the functionality: SLEP, HIBN, DRIV, DIR, DIRP, CHDR, RUN, RUNX, DEL, WIPE, MOVE, FTIM, NEWF, DOWN, ZDWN, UPLD, PVEW, PKIL, CMDL, DIE, GCFG, SCFG, TCON, PEEX, PEIN.\r\n\r\nIt has aclui.dll as the internal DLL name. It contains statically linked code from open-source libraries like libcurl (version 7.47.1) or zLib (version 0.15).\r\n\r\nBanPolMex RAT was delivered for victims of a watering hole campaign targeting employees of Polish and Mexican banks, that was discovered in February 2017. It is usually loaded by HOTWAX.",

The threat actors also use the double extortion method by stealing an affected organization’s files and leaking them online if the ransom is not paid on time. BianLian gains access to victim systems through valid Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, uses open-source tools and command-line scripting for discovery and credential harvesting, and exfiltrates victim data via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Rclone, or Mega. BianLian originally employed a double-extortion model in which they encrypted victims’ systems after exfiltrating the data; however, around January 2023, they shifted to primarily exfiltration-based extortion. The BianLian ransomware uses goroutines and encrypts files in chunks to quickly hijack an infected system. The ransomware adds its own extension to each encrypted file. ",

      "description": "According to Bitdefender, BitRAT is a notorious remote access trojan (RAT) marketed on underground cybercriminal web markets and forums. Its price tag of $20 for lifetime access makes it irresistible to cybercriminals and helps the malicious payload spread.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, each buyer’s modus operandi makes BitRAT even harder to stop, considering it can be employed in various operations, such as trojanized software, phishing and watering hole attacks.\r\n\r\nBitRAT’s popularity arises from its versatility. The malicious tool can perform a wide range of operations, including data exfiltration, UAC bypass, DDoS attacks, clipboard monitoring, gaining unauthorized webcam access, credential theft, audio recording, XMRig coin mining and generic keylogging.",

ALPHV is written in the Rust programming language and supports execution on Windows, Linux-based operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ReadyNAS, Synology), and VMWare ESXi. ALPHV is marketed as ALPHV on cybercrime forums, but is commonly called BlackCat by security researchers due to an icon of a black cat appearing on its leak site. ALPHV has been observed being deployed in ransomware attacks since November 18, 2021.\r\n\r\nALPHV can be configured to encrypt files using either the AES or ChaCha20 algorithms. In order to maximize the amount of ransomed data, ALPHV can delete volume shadow copies, stop processes and services, and stop virtual machines on ESXi servers. ALPHV can self-propagate by using PsExec to remote execute itself on other hosts on the local network.",

      "description": "BlackEnergy, its first version shortened as BE1, started as a crimeware being sold in the Russian cyber underground as early as 2007. Initially, it was designed as a toolkit for creating botnets for conducting DDoS attacks. It supported a variety of flooding commands including protocols like ICMP, TCP SYN, UDP, HTTP and DNS. Among the high profile targets of cyber attacks utilising BE1 were a Norwegian bank and government websites in Georgia three weeks before Russo-Georgian War.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 of BlackEnergy, BE2, came in 2008 with a complete code rewrite that introduced a protective layer, a kernel-mode rootkit and a modular architecture. Plugins included mostly DDoS attacks, a spam plugin and two banking authentication plugins to steal from Russian nad Ukrainian banks. The banking plugin was paired with a module designed to destroy the filesystem. Moreover, BE2 was able to\r\n- download and execute a remote file;\r\n- execute a local file on the infected computer;\r\n- update the bot and its plugins;\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an alert warning that BE2 was leveraging the human-machine interfaces of industrial control systems like GE CIMPLICITY, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC to gain access to critical infrastructure networks.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the BlackEnergy toolkit, BE3, switched to a lighter footprint with no kernel-mode driver component. Its plugins included:\r\n- operations with victim's filesystem\r\n- spreading with a parasitic infector\r\n- spying features like keylogging, screenshoots or a robust password stealer\r\n- Team viewer and a simple pseudo “remote desktop”\r\n- listing Windows accounts and scanning network \r\n- destroying the system\r\n\r\nTypical for distribution of BE3 was heavy use of spear-phishing emails containing Microsoft Word or Excel documents with a malicious VBA macro, Rich Text Format (RTF) documents embedding exploits or a PowerPoint presentation with zero-day exploit CVE-2014-4114.\r\n\r\nOn 23 December 2015, attackers behind the BlackEnergy malware successfully caused power outages for several hours in different regions of Ukraine. This cyber sabotage against three energy companies has been confirmed by the Ukrainian government. The power grid compromise has become known as the first-of-its-kind cyber warfare attack affecting civilians.",

It operates by encrypting data for the purpose of making ransom demands for the decryption tools. In other words, files affected by BlackMatter are rendered inaccessible, and victims are asked to pay - to recover access to their data.\r\n\r\nDuring the encryption process, files are appended with an extension consisting of a random character string. For example, a file initially named \"1.jpg\" would appear as something similar to \"1.jpg.k5RO9fVOl\". After this process is complete, the ransomware changes the desktop wallpaper and created a ransom note - \"[random_string].README.txt\" (e.g., k5RO9fVOl.README.txt).",

The commands are indexed by 16-bit integers, starting with the index 0x2009 and going incrementally up to 0x2057, with some indicis being skipped. \r\nIt uses various parameter names in its HTTP POST requests, mostly associated with web servers running bulletin board systems, like bbs, article, boardid, s_board, page, idx_num, etc.\r\nIt contains specific RTTI symbols like \".?AVCHTTP_Protocol@@\", \".?AVCFileRW@@\" or \".?AVCSinSocket@@\".\r\nBLINDINGCAN RAT is a flagship payload deployed in many Lazarus attacks, especially in the Operation DreamJob campaigns happening in 2020-2022.",

CargoBay is usually distributed via phishing emails, and the malware binaries may be disguised as legitimate applications. Upon execution, the malware starts by performing environmental checks such as checking its execution path and the configured system language. If the tests pass, then the malware proceeds to gather basic system information and register with its C2 via HTTP from which it receives JSON-formatted jobs to carry out.

The most important functionality is to load a received buffer, either as a DLL via the MemoryModule implementation, or as a shellcode.\r\n\r\nIt uses AES for encryption and decryption of network traffic. It usually sends the following information back to its C&C server: computer name, product name and the list of running processes. Typically, it uses two hardcoded parameter names for its initial HTTP POST requests: gametype and type (alternatively: type and code).\r\n\r\nThe CLOUDBURST payload is disguised as mscoree.dll and is side-loaded via a legitimate Windows binary PresentationHost.exe with the argument -embeddingObject. It comes either as a trojanized plugin project for Notepad++ (usually FingerText by erinata), or as a standalone DLL loaded by a dropper, which is a trojanized plugin project as well (usually NppyPlugin by Jari Pennanen).\r\n\r\nThe CLOUDBURST malware was used in Operation DreamJob attacks against an aerospace company and a network running Microsoft Intune software in Q2-Q3 2022.",

Beacon includes a wealth of functionality to the attacker, including, but not limited to command execution, key logging, file transfer, SOCKS proxying, privilege escalation, mimikatz, port scanning and lateral movement. Beacon is in-memory/file-less, in that it consists of stageless or multi-stage shellcode that once loaded by exploiting a vulnerability or executing a shellcode loader, will reflectively load itself into the memory of a process without touching the disk. It supports C2 and staging over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB named pipes as well as forward and reverse TCP; Beacons can be daisy-chained. Cobalt Strike comes with a toolkit for developing shellcode loaders, called Artifact Kit.\r\n\r\nThe Beacon implant has become popular amongst targeted attackers and criminal users as it is well written, stable, and highly customizable.",

The payload was encrypted using RC4 and added to the cryptostub as a resource. The encryption key itself was stored inside the resource as well. Upon start the cryptostub would extract the key, decrypt the payload and perform a selfinjection using the now decrypted payload.\r\nNote: The packed sample provided contains some harmless payload, while the unpacked sample is the bare cryptostub without a payload.",

      "description": "ColdStealer is a relatively new malicious program that was discovered in 2022. Like many other stealers its main purpose is to steal credentials and information from web browsers, in addition to stealing cryptocurrency wallets, FTP credentials, various files and information about the system such as OS version, system language, processor type and clipboard data. When the infostealer collects information that will be stolen, it saves the information in the ZIP form instead of files in the memory. Doing so will allow the malware to bypass detection as there are no traces of files and execution. The only known method of delivering stolen information to cybercriminals is by sending a ZIP archive to the hardcoded command and control (C2) server.",

This loader employs various techniques to evade detection, such as excluding the Import Address Table (IAT) and utilizing encrypted strings to complicate analysis. Similar to other loader malware, Colibri can be utilized to deploy information-stealing malware, potentially leading to significant loss of sensitive data. As a result, users should exercise caution when encountering unfamiliar files on their systems.",

As the initial connection, the client exchanges the keys with the server via the Diffie–Hellman key agreement protocol for the elliptic curve secp521r1. The client generates a random 32-bytes long private key, and the server responds with its public key in a buffer starting with the wide character \"0\".\r\n\r\nNext, the clients sends the current local time, and the server responds with a buffer containing multiple values separated with the pipe symbol. The typical values are the encrypted payload, the export to execute, and the MD5 hash of the decrypted DLL to verify the authenticity of the payload. \r\n\r\nThere are variants of ComeBacker without statically linked OpenSSL. In that case, the key exchange is omitted and AES CBC is replaced with HC-256.\r\n",

DanaBot’s modular nature enables it to download additional components, increasing the flexibility and robust stealing and remote monitoring capabilities of this banker. ",

It typically delivers popular information stealers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as AgentTesla, AsyncRat, NanoCore, and RedLine. While it appears to primarily deliver commodity malware, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers identified DarkTortilla samples delivering targeted payloads such as Cobalt Strike and Metasploit. It can also deliver \"addon packages\" such as additional malicious payloads, benign decoy documents, and executables. It features robust anti-analysis and anti-tamper controls that can make detection, analysis, and eradication challenging.\r\n\r\nFrom January 2021 through May 2022, an average of 93 unique DarkTortilla samples per week were uploaded to the VirusTotal analysis service. Code similarities suggest possible links between DarkTortilla and other malware: a crypter operated by the RATs Crew threat group, which was active between 2008 and 2012, and the Gameloader malware that emerged in 2021.",

As a post-exploitation C&C framework, DeimosC2 will generate the payloads that need to be manually executed on computer servers that have been compromised through other means such as social engineering, exploitation, or brute-force attacks. Once it is deployed, the threat actors will gain the same access to the systems as the user account that the payload was executed as, either as an administrator or a regular user.

To achieve persistence, the malware registers a new local port monitor – a trick falling under the “Port Monitors” technique in the MITRE ATT&CK knowledgebase. For that, the malware uses the “Windows Default Print Monitor” name; that’s why we have named it DePriMon. Due to its complexity and modular architecture, researcher believe it to be a framework.\r\n\r\nDePriMon has been active since at least March 2017. DePriMon was detected in a private company, based in Central Europe, and at dozens of computers in the Middle East.",

This backdoor collects basic system information, which it then transmits to the C2 server. In return, it receives an AES-encrypted payload. Notably, the Minodo Backdoor is designed to contact a different C2 address for domain-joined systems. This suggests that more capable backdoors, such as Cobalt Strike, are downloaded on higher-value targets instead of Project Nemesis.",

      "description": "OxCERT blog describes Dridex as \"an evasive, information-stealing malware variant; its goal is to acquire as many credentials as possible and return them via an encrypted tunnel to a Command-and-Control (C&C) server. These C&C servers are numerous and scattered all over the Internet, if the malware cannot reach one server it will try another. For this reason, network-based measures such as blocking the C&C IPs is effective only in the short-term.\"\r\nAccording to MalwareBytes, \"Dridex uses an older tactic of infection by attaching a Word document that utilizes macros to install malware. However, once new versions of Microsoft Office came out and users generally updated, such a threat subsided because it was no longer simple to infect a user with this method.\"\r\nIBM X-Force discovered \"a new version of the Dridex banking Trojan that takes advantage of a code injection technique called AtomBombing to infect systems. AtomBombing is a technique for injecting malicious code into the 'atom tables' that almost all versions of Windows uses to store certain application data. It is a variation of typical code injection attacks that take advantage of input validation errors to insert and to execute malicious code in a legitimate process or application. Dridex v4 is the first malware that uses the AtomBombing process to try and infect systems.\"",

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA), detected a new malware named \"DUSTMAN\" that was detonated on December 29, 2019. Based on analyzed evidence and artifacts found on machines in a victim’s network that were not wiped by the malware. NCSC assess that the threat actor behind the attack had some kind of urgency on executing the files on the date of the attack due to multiple OPSEC failures observed on the infected network. NCSC is calling the malware used in this attack \"DUSTMAN\" after the filename and string embedded in the malware. \"DUSTMAN\" can be considered as a new variant of \"ZeroCleare\" malware,\r\npublished in December 2019.",

Since July 2023, the information stealer has been sold on the underground market, advertising a variety of capabilities, such as the ability to target crypto wallets and passwords. Based on VirusTotal data, it appears that developer test samples were uploaded in June 2023. The panel for the stealer is installed on the buyer's own infrastructure, allowing for exclusive control. The stated pricing models are: $35 for 7 days, $115 for 30 days, and $250 for 90 days. Given its user-friendly panel design and the affordable price range, combined with similar capabilities to other information stealers, Easy Stealer is likely to see an increase in distribution among various cyber criminals as it continues through active development.",

For example, since mid 2018 it is used by Trickbot for installs, which may also lead to ransomware attacks using Ryuk, a combination observed several times against high-profile targets.\r\nIt is always stealing information from victims but what the criminal gang behind it did, was to open up another business channel by selling their infrastructure delivering additional malicious software. From malware analysts it has been classified into epochs depending on command and control, payloads, and delivery solutions which change over time.\r\nEmotet had been taken down by authorities in January 2021, though it appears to have sprung back to life in November 2021.",

It is generally dropped by the MiniDuke backdoor, but ESET also have seen the operators dropping FatDuke using lateral movement tools such as PsExec.The operators regularly repack this malware in order to evade detections. The most recent sample of FatDuke that ESET have seen was compiled on May 24, 2019. They have seen them trying to regain control of a machine multiple times in a few days, each time with  a different sample. Their packer, described in a later section, adds a lot of code, leading to large binaries. While the effective code should not be larger than 1MB, ESET have seen one sample weighing in at 13MB, hence our name for this backdoor component: FatDuke.",

Through their aggressive, albeit unusual, marketing strategies and constant recruitment of affiliates, they were able to globally distribute a high volume of their malware.\r\n\r\nIn a surprising announcement on May 31, 2019, the GandCrab’s operators posted on a dark web forum, announced the end of a little more than a year of ransomware operations, citing staggering profit figures. However, If there’s one thing that sets these threat actors apart from other groups, it is that they are unpredictable; so there is always the possibility that they might re-surface in one form or another.",

This first version of Gozi was developed by Nikita Kurmin, and he borrowed code from Ursnif aka Snifula, a spyware developed by Alexey Ivanov around 2000, and some other kits. Gozi v1.0 thus had a formgrabber module and often is classified as Ursnif aka Snifula.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, the source code of a particular Gozi CRM dll version was leaked, which led to Vawtrak/Neverquest (in combination with Pony) via Gozi Prinimalka (a slightly modified Gozi v1.0) and Gozi v2.0 (aka 'Gozi ISFB' aka 'ISFB' aka Pandemyia). This version came with a webinject module.",

After the cards are first scanned, the personal account number (PAN) and accompanying data sit in the point-of-sale system’s memory unencrypted while the system determines where to send it for authorization. \r\nMasked as the LogMein software, the GratefulPOS malware appears to have emerged during the fall 2017 shopping season with low detection ratio according to some of the earliest detections displayed on VirusTotal.

      "description": "Havex is a remote access trojan (RAT) that was discovered in 2013 as part of a widespread espionage campaign targeting industrial control systems (ICS) used across numerous industries and attributed to a hacking group referred to as \"Dragonfly\" and \"Energetic Bear\". Havex is estimated to have impacted thousands of infrastructure sites, a majority of which were located in Europe and the United States. Within the energy sector, Havex specifically targeted energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and industrial equipment providers. Havex also impacted organizations in the aviation, defense, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, Havex scanned the infected system to locate any Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) or ICS devices on the network and sent the data back to command and control servers. To do so, the malware leveraged the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard, which is a universal communication protocol used by ICS components across many industries that facilitates open connectivity and vendor equipment interoperability. Havex used the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to connect to OPC servers inside of an ICS network and collect information such as CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.\r\n\r\nHavex was an intelligence-collection tool used for espionage and not for the disruption or destruction of industrial systems. However, the data collected by Havex would have aided efforts to design and develop attacks against specific targets or industries.",

      "description": "According to Proofpoint, IcedID (aka BokBot) is a malware originally classified as a banking malware and was first observed in 2017. It also acts as a loader for other malware, including ransomware.  The well-known IcedID version consists of an initial loader which contacts a Loader C2 server, downloads the standard DLL Loader, which then delivers the standard IcedID Bot. IcedID is developed and operated by the actor named LUNAR SPIDER.\r\n\r\nAs previously published, historically there has been just one version of IcedID that has remained constant since 2017.\r\n* In November 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed the first new variant of IcedID Proofpoint dubbed 'IcedID Lite' distributed as a follow-on payload in a TA542 Emotet campaign. It was dropped by the Emotet malware soon after the actor returned to the e-crime landscape after a nearly four-month break.\r\n* The IcedID Lite Loader observed in November 2022 contains a static URL to download a 'Bot Pack' file with a static name (botpack.dat) which results in the IcedID Lite DLL Loader, and then delivers the Forked version of IcedID Bot, leaving out the webinjects and backconnect functionality that would typically be used for banking fraud.\r\n* Starting in February 2023, Proofpoint observed the new Forked variant of IcedID. This variant was distributed by TA581 and one unattributed threat activity cluster which acted as initial access facilitators. The campaigns used a variety of email attachments such as Microsoft OneNote attachments and somewhat rare to see .URL attachments, which led to the Forked variant of IcedID.",

They were feature-rich backdoors and turned the affected computer into a video camera, letting the attackers to spy the victim. \r\nThe malicious actors behind this malware were active at least since 2013 in highly targeted campaigns with only a few dozen compromised computers in Ukraine and Russia. The wrapper DLL posed as a legitimate mpr.dll library and was placed in the same folder as explorer.exe, which made it being loaded during the Windows startup into the Windows Explorer process instead of the legitimate library.\r\nMalware came in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, which made this persistence technique functional on both architectures.\r\n\r\nThe smaller of the modules, RC2FM, contained a backdoor with fifteen supported commands indexed by numbers. The commands could perform simple changes on the system and spying features like capturing sounds, taking screenshots or monitoring all fixed and removable drives.\r\n\r\nThe second module, RC2CL, offered features for collecting as much data about the infected computer as possible, rather than for making system changes. The module supported up to 84 commands such as file system operations, file execution, registry key manipulation, remote shell activation, wireless network scanning, listing of installed software etc. Though the backdoor was capable of interfering with the system (e.g. to log off a user, terminate a process or shut down the system), it mostly provided passive operations. Whenever possible, it tried to hide its activities by restoring the original file access time or safe-deleting its traces. ",

      "description": "2006 Gozi v1.0, Gozi CRM, CRM, Papras\r\n2010 Gozi v2.0, Gozi ISFB, ISFB, Pandemyia(*)\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, the source code of a particular Gozi CRM dll version was leaked. This led to two main branches: one became known as Gozi Prinimalka, which was merge with Pony and became Vawtrak/Neverquest.\r\n\r\nThe other branch became known as Gozi ISFB, or ISFB in short. Webinject functionality was added to this version.\r\n\r\nThere is one panel which often was used in combination with ISFB: IAP. The panel's login page comes with the title 'Login - IAP'. The body contains 'AUTHORIZATION', 'Name:', 'Password:' and a single button 'Sign in' in a minimal design. Often, the panel is directly accessible by entering the C2 IP address in a browser. But there are ISFB versions which are not directly using IAP. The bot accesses a gate, which is called the 'Dreambot' gate. See win.dreambot for further information.\r\n\r\nISFB often was protected by Rovnix. This led to a further complication in the naming scheme - many companies started to call ISFB Rovnix. Because the signatures started to look for Rovnix, other trojans protected by Rovnix (in particular ReactorBot and Rerdom) sometimes got wrongly labelled.\r\n\r\nIn April 2016 a combination of Gozi ISFB and Nymaim was detected. This breed became known as GozNym. The merge uses a shellcode-like version of Gozi ISFB, that needs Nymaim to run. The C2 communication is performed by Nymaim.\r\n\r\nSee win.gozi for additional historical information.",

Such generic malware detections usually have many “sub-families”, distinguished by the detection suffix (e.g. KillDisk.NBO, KillDisk.NCV, and KillDisk.NCX). Sub-family variants that do have strong code similarities, are sometimes seen in separate cyberattacks and thus can help researchers make connections between them. ",

The malware is primarily spread through phishing campaigns and exploit kits. Once installed on a victim's computer, Kronos can capture login credentials, credit card details, and other personal information by keylogging and form grabbing techniques. It can also bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication. Kronos employs advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection by antivirus software and actively updates itself to evade security patches. It has been known to target a wide range of banking systems and has affected numerous organizations worldwide. The malware continues to evolve, making it a significant threat to online banking security.",

      "description": "FireEye describes this malware as a highly obfuscated bot that has been in the wild since mid-2013. It has managed to leave hardly any traces on the Internet, is capable of watching its victims without ever being noticed, and can even corrupt a hard disk, thus making a PC useless.\r\n\r\nUsing Dynamic Threat Intelligence, they have observed multiple campaigns targeting multiple industries in the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Canada, Peru and Poland – primarily in the financial services and insurance sectors. Although the infection strategy is not new, the final payload dropped – which they named LATENTBOT – caught attention since it implements several layers of obfuscation, a unique exfiltration mechanism, and has been very successful at infecting multiple organizations.",

Lightless is able to execute them discreetly within the RAT itself, rather than being executed visibly in the system console. This provides stealthiness, both in evading real-time monitoring solutions like EDRs, and postmortem digital forensic tools.\r\n\r\nLightlessCan use RC6 for decryption of its configuration, and also for encryption and decryption of network traffic.\r\n",

Proofpoint first observed Loda in September of 2016 and it has since grown in popularity. The name Loda is derived from a directory to which the malware author chose to write keylogger logs. It should be noted that some antivirus products currently detect Loda as “Trojan.Nymeria”, although the connection is not well-documented.",

      "description": "\"Loki Bot is a commodity malware sold on underground sites which is designed to steal private data from infected machines, and then submit that info to a command and control host via HTTP POST. This private data includes stored passwords, login credential information from Web browsers, and a variety of cryptocurrency wallets.\" - PhishMe\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot employs function hashing to obfuscate the libraries utilized. While not all functions are hashed, a vast majority of them are.\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot accepts a single argument/switch of ‘-u’ that simply delays execution (sleeps) for 10 seconds. This is used when Loki-Bot is upgrading itself.\r\n\r\nThe Mutex generated is the result of MD5 hashing the Machine GUID and trimming to 24-characters. For example: “B7E1C2CC98066B250DDB2123“.\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot creates a hidden folder within the %APPDATA% directory whose name is supplied by the 8th thru 13th characters of the Mutex. For example: “%APPDATA%\\ C98066\\”.\r\n\r\nThere can be four files within the hidden %APPDATA% directory at any given time: “.exe,” “.lck,” “.hdb” and “.kdb.” They will be named after characters 13 thru 18 of the Mutex. For example: “6B250D.” Below is the explanation of their purpose:\r\n\r\nFILE EXTENSION\tFILE DESCRIPTION\r\n.exe\tA copy of the malware that will execute every time the user account is logged into\r\n.lck\tA lock file created when either decrypting Windows Credentials or Keylogging to prevent resource conflicts\r\n.hdb\tA database of hashes for data that has already been exfiltrated to the C2 server\r\n.kdb\tA database of keylogger data that has yet to be sent to the C2 server\r\n\r\nIf the user is privileged, Loki-Bot sets up persistence within the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. If not, it sets up persistence under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.\r\n\r\nThe first packet transmitted by Loki-Bot contains application data.\r\n\r\nThe second packet transmitted by Loki-Bot contains decrypted Windows credentials.\r\n\r\nThe third packet transmitted by Loki-Bot is the malware requesting C2 commands from the C2 server. By default, Loki-Bot will send this request out every 10 minutes after the initial packet it sent.\r\n\r\nCommunications to the C2 server from the compromised host contain information about the user and system including the username, hostname, domain, screen resolution, privilege level, system architecture, and Operating System.\r\n\r\nThe first WORD of the HTTP Payload represents the Loki-Bot version.\r\n\r\nThe second WORD of the HTTP Payload is the Payload Type. Below is the table of identified payload types:\r\n\r\nBYTE\tPAYLOAD TYPE\r\n0x26\tStolen Cryptocurrency Wallet\r\n0x27\tStolen Application Data\r\n0x28\tGet C2 Commands from C2 Server\r\n0x29\tStolen File\r\n0x2A\tPOS (Point of Sale?)\r\n0x2B\tKeylogger Data\r\n0x2C\tScreenshot\r\n\r\nThe 11th byte of the HTTP Payload begins the Binary ID. This might be useful in tracking campaigns or specific threat actors. This value value is typically “ckav.ru”. If you come across a Binary ID that is different from this, take note!\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot encrypts both the URL and the registry key used for persistence using Triple DES encryption.\r\n\r\nThe Content-Key HTTP Header value is the result of hashing the HTTP Header values that precede it. This is likely used as a protection against researchers who wish to poke and prod at Loki-Bot’s C2 infrastructure.\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot can accept the following instructions from the C2 Server:\r\n\r\nBYTE\tINSTRUCTION DESCRIPTION\r\n0x00\tDownload EXE & Execute\r\n0x01\tDownload DLL & Load #1\r\n0x02\tDownload DLL & Load #2\r\n0x08\tDelete HDB File\r\n0x09\tStart Keylogger\r\n0x0A\tMine & Steal Data\r\n0x0E\tExit Loki-Bot\r\n0x0F\tUpgrade Loki-Bot\r\n0x10\tChange C2 Polling Frequency\r\n0x11\tDelete Executables & Exit\r\n\r\nSuricata Signatures\r\nRULE SID\tRULE NAME\r\n2024311\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Cryptocurrency Wallet Exfiltration Detected\r\n2024312\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Application/Credential Data Exfiltration Detected M1\r\n2024313\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Request for C2 Commands Detected M1\r\n2024314\tET TROJAN Loki Bot File Exfiltration Detected\r\n2024315\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Keylogger Data Exfiltration Detected M1\r\n2024316\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Screenshot Exfiltration Detected\r\n2024317\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Application/Credential Data Exfiltration Detected M2\r\n2024318\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Request for C2 Commands Detected M2\r\n2024319\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Keylogger Data Exfiltration Detected M2",

A single configuration file, jer.dll, is dropped, and it contains base64‑encoded text that corresponds to AES‑encrypted strings.\r\nGoogleCrash.exe is the main component of the malware. It schedules execution of the other two components and creates Windows Task Scheduler tasks to achieve persistence.\r\nRegarding the geolocation of victims, Chrome.exe collects data about nearby Wi-Fi networks and sends it to the Mozilla Location Service API. In short, this application provides geolocation coordinates when it’s given other sources of data such as Bluetooth beacons, cell towers or Wi-Fi access points. Then the malware takes latitude and longitude coordinates to build a Google Maps URL.\r\nThe GoogleUpdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the remote C&C server. The configuration to set the connection is read from the jer.dll file: domain name, username and password. The principal means of communication for Machete is via FTP, although HTTP communication was implemented as a fallback in 2019.",

      "description": "According to Talos, MagicRAT is programmed in C++ programming language and uses the Qt Framework by statically linking it to the RAT on 32- and 64-bit versions. The Qt Framework is a programming library for developing graphical user interfaces, of which this RAT has none. Talos thinks that the objective was to increase the complexity of the code, thus making human analysis harder. On the other hand, since there are very few examples (if any) of malware programmed with Qt Framework, this also makes machine learning and heuristic analysis detection less reliable. The RAT uses the Qt classes throughout its entire code. The configuration is dynamically stored in a QSettings class eventually being saved to disk, a typical functionality provided by that class.\r\n\r\nMagicRAT provides the operator with a remote shell on the victim's system for arbitrary command execution, along with the ability to rename, move and delete files on the endpoint. The operator can determine the timing for the implant to sleep, change the C2 URLs and delete the implant from the infected system.",

However, it has remained active since then, continually updating its tactics by employing new obfuscation techniques and methods of evasion. In April 2022, Magniber gained notoriety for disguising itself as a Windows update file to lure victims into installing it. It then began spreading via JavaScript in September 2022.",

After execution, this malware terminates a number of processes such as database processes, likely to allow access to any files that these programs may have held open. Ordinypt will avoid wiping certain files and folders in order to prevent the infected machine from becoming unusable. Affected files are overwritten with null character and receive a random 5 character file extension. Finally, shadow copies are removed and Windows startup repair is disabled to complicate recovery of data from the affected system. The desktop background is changed and a ransom note is dropped for the victim. A C2 check-in occurs to keep track of the file extension used on that specific machine, as well as which BitCoin address was randomly provided for payment to the victim (drawn from a long list stored in the ransomware configuration).

It was first detected in February 2023 and was distributed by TA581 along with an unattributed threat activity cluster that facilitated initial access. In this version, the configuration file is no longer encrypted using a simple XOR algorithm with a 64-byte key. Instead, it uses a custom algorithm previously used by the Standard core loader. This algorithm decrypts DLL strings that are needed to resolve handles to the necessary DLLs later on. The strings are decrypted using an algorithm that splits the data into DWORDs and XORs it against a random key. The main objective of PHOTOFORK remains the same as GZIPLOADER, i.e. to deliver an encrypted bot and core DLL loader (forked) that loads the Forked ICEDID bot into memory using a custom PE format.",

Despite being in the early stages of development, it already demonstrates advanced techniques in evasion, injection, and anti-analysis. Notably, the loader component incorporates an array of sophisticated anti-debugging and anti-VM measures inspired by the open-source Al-Khaser project, while leveraging steganography to conceal its payload. Additionally, Pikabot utilizes a proprietary C2 framework and supports a diverse range of commands, encompassing host enumeration and advanced secondary payload injection options.",

      "description": "RSA describes PlugX as a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware family that is around since 2008 and is used as a backdoor to control the victim's machine fully. Once the device is infected, an attacker can remotely execute several kinds of commands on the affected system.\r\n\r\nNotable features of this malware family are the ability to execute commands on the affected machine to retrieve:\r\nmachine information\r\ncapture the screen\r\nsend keyboard and mouse events\r\nkeylogging\r\nreboot the system\r\nmanage processes (create, kill and enumerate)\r\nmanage services (create, start, stop, etc.); and\r\nmanage Windows registry entries, open a shell, etc.\r\n\r\nThe malware also logs its events in a text log file.",

      "description": "PostNapTea aka SIGNBT is an HTTP(S) RAT that is written as a complex object-oriented project.\r\n\r\nIn 2022-2023, it was deployed against targets like a newspaper organization, agriculture-related entity or a software vendor. The initial access was usually achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in widely-used software in South Korea.\r\n\r\nIt collects various information about the victim’s computer, such as computer name, product name, OS details, system uptime, CPU information, system locale, time zone, network status, and malware configuration. \r\n\r\nPostNapTea uses AES for encryption and decryption ot network traffic. There is a constant prefix SIGNBT occuring in its HTTP POST requests. The prefix is concatenated with 2 characters that identify the communication stage:\r\n• LG: logging into the C&C server\r\n• KE: acknowledging the succesful login to the C&C\r\n• FI: sending the status of a failed operation \r\n• SR: sending the status of a successful operation\r\n• GC: getting the next command\r\n\r\nThere are five classes that represent command groups:\r\n• CCButton: for file manipulation and screen capturing\r\n• CCBitmap: for network commands, implementing functionality of Windows commands often abused by attackers, like sc, reg, arp, net, ver, wmic, ping, whoami, netstat, tracert, lookup, ipconfig,\r\nsysteminfo, and netsh advfirewall. \r\n• CCComboBox: for file system management\r\n• CCList: for process management\r\n• CCBrush: for control of the malware itself\r\n\r\nIt stores its configuration in JSON format. It resolves the Windows APIs it requires during runtime, via the Fowler–Noll–Vo (FNV) hash function.\r\n\r\nIts internal name in the version-information resource is usually ppcsnap.dll or pconsnap.dll, which loosely inspired its code name.",

According to one source, ransom amounts demanded as part of PwndLocker activity range from $175k USD to $650k USD depending on the size of the network. PwndLocker attempts to disable a variety of Windows services so that their data can be encrypted. Various processes will also be targeted, such as web browsers and software related to security, backups, and databases. Shadow copies are cleared by the ransomware, and encryption of files occurs once the system has been prepared in this way. Executable files and those that are likely to be important for the system to continue to function appear to be skipped by the ransomware, and a large number of folders mostly related to Microsoft Windows system files are also ignored. As of March 2020, encrypted files have been observed with the added extensions of .key and .pwnd. Ransom notes are dropped in folders where encrypted files are found and also on the user's desktop.",

For this reason, Ramnit primarily targets individuals rather than focusing on particular industries.\r\n\r\nRamnit campaigns have been observed to target organizations in particular industries. For example, a 2019 campaign targeted financial organizations in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Canada.",

      "description": "RedLine Stealer is a malware available on underground forums for sale apparently as standalone ($100/$150 depending on the version) or also on a subscription basis ($100/month). This malware harvests information from browsers such as saved credentials, autocomplete data, and credit card information. A system inventory is also taken when running on a target machine, to include details such as the username, location data, hardware configuration, and information regarding installed security software. More recent versions of RedLine added the ability to steal cryptocurrency. FTP and IM clients are also apparently targeted by this family, and this malware has the ability to upload and download files, execute commands, and periodically send back information about the infected computer.",

It was first publicly revealed by Kaspersky Lab, Symantec, and The Intercept in November 2014. Regin malware targeted victims in a range of industries, telecom, government, and financial institutions. It was engineered to be modular and over time dozens of modules have been found and attributed to this family. Symantec observed around 100 infections in 10 different countries across a variety of organisations including private companies, government entities, and research institutes.",

It's primary functionality is to assist the attacker with stealing credentials for online banking websites. It is typically targeted against Swiss banks. The malware binary itself is primarily a dropper component for a Javascript file which builds a VBA file which in turn loads multiple tools onto the host including: 7zip and TOR. The VBA installs a new root certificate and then forwards all traffic via TOR to the attacker controlled host in order to effectively MITM TLS traffic.",

Data for value is set to the full path and filename of the currently running executable.

The Reg Value used is the hardcoded value of 'lNOWZyAWVv' :\r\n  * SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\lNOWZyAWVv\r\n* Before exiting, REvil sets up its malicious executable to be deleted upon reboot by issuing a call to MoveFileExW and setting the destination to NULL and the flags to 4 (MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT).

Likely the result of the blog posted by us.\r\n* Modified handling of network file encryption. Now explicitly passes every possible \"Scope\" constant to the WNetOpenEnum function when looking for files to encrypt. It also changed the 'Resource Type\" from RESOURCETYPE_DISK to RESOURCETYPE_ANY which will now include things like mapped printers.\r\n* Persistence registry value changed from 'lNOWZyAWVv' to 'sNpEShi30R'\r\n* Changes registry key values from --> to:\r\n  * tgE --> 73g\r\n  * 8K09 --> vTGj\r\n  * xMtNc --> Q7PZe\r\n  * CTgE4a --> BuCrIp\r\n  * oE5bZg0 --> lcZd7OY\r\n  * DC408Qp4 --> sLF86MWC\r\n------------------------------------\r\nREvil v1.07\r\nMD5: ea4cae3d6d8150215a4d90593a4c30f2\r\nSHA1: 8dcbcbefaedf5675b170af3fd44db93ad864894e\r\nSHA256: 6a2bd52a5d68a7250d1de481dcce91a32f54824c1c540f0a040d05f757220cd3\r\nTBD",

      "description": "NJCCIC characterizes RunningRAT as a remote access trojan (RAT) that operates using two DLL files. When the trojan is loaded onto a system, it executes the first DLL. This is used to disable anti-malware solutions, unpack and execute the main RAT DLL, and gain persistence. The trojan installs a Windows batch file dx.bat that attempts to kill the daumcleaner.exe task, a Korean security program. The file then attempts to remove itself. Once the second DLL is loaded into memory, the first DLL overwrites the IP address for the control server to change the address the trojan communicates with. The second DLL gathers information about the victim's system, including its operating system and driver and processor information. The RAT can log user keystrokes, copy the clipboard, delete files, compress files, clear event logs, shut down the machine, and more. The second DLL also uses several anti-bugging techniques.",

      "description": "F-Secure states that the Sality virus family has been circulating in the wild as early as 2003. Over the years, the malware has been developed and improved with the addition of new features, such as rootkit or backdoor functionality, and so on, keeping it an active and relevant threat despite the relative age of the malware.\r\n\r\nModern Sality variants also have the ability to communicate over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, allowing an attacker to control a botnet of Sality-infected machines. The combined resources of the Sality botnet may also be used by its controller(s) to perform other malicious actions, such as attacking routers.\r\n\r\nInfection\r\nSality viruses typically infect executable files on local, shared and removable drives. In earlier variants, the Sality virus simply added its own malicious code to the end of the infected (or host) file, a technique known as prepending. The viral code that Sality inserts is polymorphic, a form of complex code that is intended to make analysis more difficult.\r\n\r\nEarlier Sality variants were regarded as technically sophisticated in that they use an Entry Point Obscuration (EPO) technique to hide their presence on the system. This technique means that the virus inserts a command somewhere in the middle of an infected file's code, so that when the system is reading the file to execute it and comes to the command, it forces the system to 'jump' to the malware's code and execute that instead. This technique was used to make discovery and disinfection of the malicious code harder.\r\n\r\nPayload\r\nOnce installed on the computer system, Sality viruses usually also execute a malicious payload. The specific actions performed depend on the specific variant in question, but generally Sality viruses will attempt to terminate processes, particularly those related to security programs. The virus may also attempt to open connections to remote sites, download and run additional malicious files, and steal data from the infected machine.",

Once ServHelper establishes remote desktop access, the malware contains functionality for the threat actor to 'hijack' legitimate user accounts or their web browser profiles and use them as they see fit. The 'downloader' variant is stripped of the tunneling and hijacking functionality and is used as a basic downloader.\"\r\n",

This malware will remove shadow copies and kill processes related to SCADA/ICS devices, virtual machines, remote management tools, network management software, and others. After this, encryption of files on the device commences, while skipping Windows system folders and various system files. A random 5 character string is appended to encrypted files. According to Bleeping Computer, this ransomware takes an especially long time to encrypt files on a targeted machine. This ransomware is reported to target an entire network, rather than individual workstations.",

      "description": "Unit 42 notes that they identified a new version of SolarMarker, a malware family known for its infostealing and backdoor capabilities, mainly delivered through search engine optimization (SEO) manipulation to convince users to download malicious documents.\r\n\r\nSome of SolarMarker’s capabilities include the exfiltration of auto-fill data, saved passwords and saved credit card information from victims’ web browsers. Besides capabilities typical for infostealers, SolarMarker has additional capabilities such as file transfer and execution of commands received from a C2 server.\r\n\r\nThe malware invests significant effort into defense evasion, which consists of techniques like signed files, huge files, impersonation of legitimate software installations and obfuscated PowerShell scripts.",

The malware steals information from browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and applications such as Discord, Pidgin, Outlook, Telegram, Skype, Element, Signal, Tox, Steam, Minecraft, and VPN clients. The binary also gathers data about the infected host, such as the running processes, Desktop and webcam screenshots, Wi-Fi networks, the Windows product key, and the public and private IP address. The stealer employs multiple anti-analysis techniques, such as detecting virtual machines, sandboxes, and malware analysis tools and checking if the process is being debugged. The malware also embedded a keylogger module and a clipper module that replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses with the threat actor’s addresses if the victim makes a transaction. The stolen information is sent to a Discord channel using a Discord Webhook.",

Hacker’s commonly take advantage of vulnerabilities in the Content Management System (CMS) or its plugins to gain entry into the target’s system. Another, simpler option is to use brute force attacks. Though quite slow, this method is still effective against administrators using weak or commonly used passwords.",

After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, it uses a DGA to generate specific subdomains for a set C&C domain. The backdoor retrieves and executes commands, that include the ability to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the machine, and disable system services. The C2 traffic to the malicious domains is designed to mimic normal SolarWinds API communications: Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol. The backdoor uses multiple obfuscated blocklists to identify forensic and anti-virus tools running as processes, services, and drivers. Multiple trojanzied updates were digitally signed from March - May 2020 and posted to the SolarWinds updates website.",

TFlower displays a console showing activity being performed by the ransomware when it encrypts a machine, further indicating that this ransomware is triggered by the attacker post compromise, similar to Samsam/Samas in terms of TTP. Once encryption is started, the ransomware will conduct a status report to an apparently hard-coded C2. Shadow copies are deleted and the Windows 10 repair environment is disabled by this ransomware. This malware also will terminate any running Outlook.exe process so that the mail files can be encrypted. This ransomware does not add an extention to encrypted files, but prepends the marker \"*tflower\" and what may be the encrypted encryption key for the file to each affected file. Once encryption is completed, another status report is sent to the C2 server.",

Most of them use Internet Explorer or Google Chrome icons and corresponding file names to disguise themselves as legitimate internet browsers. The malware decrypts the embedded payload at runtime. It uses an embedded 16-byte XOR key to decrypt the base64 encoded payload. The decrypted payload is another portable executable file that runs in memory. Before getting decrypted with a hardcoded XOR key, the backdoor also checks for sandbox environment.\r\nThe backdoor has some code overlap with a know malware family PEBBLEDASH, attributed to Lazarus/LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.",

According to news reports, Tinba has been found targeting bank customers in the United States and Europe.\r\n\r\nIf Tinba successfully infects a device, it can steal banking and personal information through webinjects. To do this, the malware monitors the user's browser activity and if specific banking portals are visited, Tinba injects code to present the victim with fake web forms designed to mimic the legitimate web site. The malware then tricks them into entering their personal information, log-in credentials, etc in the legitimate-looking page.\r\n\r\nTinba may also display socially-engineered messages to lure or pressure the user into entering their information on the fake page; for example, a message may be shown which attempts to convince the victim that funds were accidentally deposited to his account and must be refunded immediately.",

However, he then proceeded to destroy his own reputation on hacker forums by promoting his development too aggressively. As a displacement activity, he published his source code on Github.

It sends the victim's MAC address in the initial request.\r\n\r\nThe response of the server informing the client about a successful authentication is \"Your request has been accepted. ClientID: {f9102bc8a7d81ef01ba}\". The client then requests additional data from the server, that decrypts to shellcode and its data parameters, and is executed. The client also creates a named pipe, \\\\.\\pipe\\fb4d1181bb09b484d058768598b, that allows inter-process communication with the executed shellcode. \r\n\r\nTorisma was usually downloaded by NedDnLoader, and deployed in the Operation DreamJob campaigns starting around Q4 2019.",

Its use of fake TLS for camouflaging the network traffic is one of the typical Lazarus traits.\r\n\r\nIt uses a simple XOR for encryption of its configuration and network traffic. \r\n\r\nIt sends detailed information about the victim's environment, like computer name, user name, IP, code page, Windows version, architecture, and time zone.\r\n\r\nIt supports more than 20 commands that include operations on the victim’s filesystem, basic process management, command line execution, file exfiltration, and the download and memory execution of an additional DLL from the C&C (by calling the expected export SamIPromote). As in many RATs from Lazarus arsenal, the commands are indexed by 32-bit integers. The lowest index is 0x3, followed by 0x10, which goes incrementally up to 0x26. Also, it can monitor newly connected drives and the number of logged-on users.\r\n\r\nIt has MPRD.dll as the internal DLL name, and a single export SamIInitialize.\r\n\r\nVyveva RAT was used in an attack against a freight logistics company in South Africa in June 2020.",

These designs include a sophisticated shellcode stager, the ability to load plugins on-the-fly, and overall evasiveness should the C2 server fail to respond with a valid session key.",

      "description": "This family describes the (initially small) loader, which downloads Zeus OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nIn June 2016, a new loader was dubbed DEloader by Fortinet. It has some functions borrowed from Zeus 2.0.8.9 (e.g. the versioning, nrv2b, binstorage-labels), but more importantly, it downloaded a Zeus-like banking trojan (-> Zeus OpenSSL). Furthermore, the loader shared its versioning with the Zeus OpenSSL it downloaded.\r\nThe initial samples from May 2016 were small (17920 bytes). At some point, visualEncrypt/Decrypt was added, e.g. in v1.11.0.0 (September 2016) with size 27648 bytes. In January 2017 with v1.15.0.0, obfuscation was added, which blew the size up to roughly 80k, and the loader became known as Zloader aka Terdot. These changes may be related to the Moskalvzapoe Distribution Network, which started the distribution of it at the same time.\r\n\r\nPlease note that IBM X-Force decided to call win.zloader/win.zeus_openssl \"Zeus Sphinx\", after mentioning it as \"a new version of Zeus Sphinx\" in their initial post in August 2016. Malpedia thus lists the alias \"Zeus XSphinx\" for win.zeus_openssl - the X to refer to IBM X-Force.",

The malware may communicate with its command and control (C2) server over The Onion Router (Tor) network if configured to do so. The malware can download several plugins, some of which include features such as cryptocurrency mining and password recovery, from browsers and email software. Zyklon also provides a very efficient mechanism to monitor the spread and impact.",
