      "description": "This object represents the behaviors associated with operators of 8Base ransomware, who may or may not operate as a cohesive unit. Behaviors associated with samples of 8Base ransomware are represented in the \"8Base Ransomware\" Software object.\n \nThe 8Base ransomware operation began claiming significant numbers of victims on its data leak site in June 2023, including organizations in a range of sectors. Researchers have observed considerable similarities between aspects of 8Base's operations and those of other ransomware groups, leading them to suspect that 8Base may be an evolution or offshoot of existing operations. The language in 8Base's ransom notes is similar to the language seen in RansomHouse's notes, and there is strong overlap between the code of Phobos ransomware and 8Base.<sup>[[VMWare 8Base June 28 2023](/references/573e9520-6181-4535-9ed3-2338688a8e9f)]</sup><sup>[[Acronis 8Base July 17 2023](/references/c9822477-1578-4068-9882-41e4d6eaee3f)]</sup>",

      "description": "This object represents the BlackCat/ALPHV Ransomware-as-a-Service (“RaaS”) apex group and the behaviors associated with its various affiliate ransomware operators. Specific affiliate operations defined by the research community will be tracked as separate objects.\n\nResearchers first observed BlackCat ransomware (AKA ALPHV or Noberus) in November 2021. An April 2022 U.S. FBI advisory linked BlackCat’s developers and money launderers to the defunct Blackmatter and Darkside ransomware operations (the latter was responsible for the major 2021 Colonial Pipeline incident).<sup>[[FBI BlackCat April 19 2022](/references/2640b58c-8413-4691-80e1-33aec9b6c7f6)]</sup> As of September 2023, BlackCat is believed to be responsible for attacking organizations globally and in virtually every major sector, and it consistently claims some of the highest victim tallies of any RaaS. According to data collected by the [ransomwatch project](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch) and analyzed by Tidal, BlackCat actors publicly claimed 233 victims in 2022, the third most of any ransomware operation in the dataset (considerably below Clop (558) but well above Hive (181)), and it already surpassed that number by July of 2023.<sup>[[GitHub ransomwatch](/references/62037959-58e4-475a-bb91-ff360d20c1d7)]</sup> Like many RaaS, BlackCat actors threaten to leak exfiltrated victim data, but they also threaten to carry out denial of service attacks if victims do not pay timely ransoms.<sup>[[BlackBerry BlackCat Threat Overview](/references/59f98ae1-c62d-460f-8d2a-9ae287b59953)]</sup>\n\nBlackCat developers have regularly evolved the namesake ransomware over time, and collaboration with affiliates means that a large number and variety of tools & TTPs are observed during intrusions involving BlackCat. BlackCat became the first prominent ransomware family to transition to the Rust programming language in 2022, which researchers assess provides greater customization and defense evasion capabilities and faster performance.<sup>[[X-Force BlackCat May 30 2023](/references/b80c1f70-9d05-4f4b-bdc2-6157c6837202)]</sup><sup>[[FBI BlackCat April 19 2022](/references/2640b58c-8413-4691-80e1-33aec9b6c7f6)]</sup> A BlackCat variant named Sphynx emerged in early 2023, featuring multiple defense evasion-focused enhancements. In Q3 2023, public reports suggested that Scattered Spider (AKA 0ktapus or UNC3944), a group attributed to several prominent intrusions involving telecommunications, technology, and casino entities, had begun to use BlackCat/Sphynx ransomware during its operations.<sup>[[Caesars Scattered Spider September 13 2023](/references/6915c003-7c8b-451c-8fb1-3541f00c14fb)]</sup><sup>[[BushidoToken Scattered Spider August 16 2023](/references/621a8320-0e3c-444f-b82a-7fd4fdf9fb67)]</sup>",

      "description": "FIN12 is a financially motivated threat actor group believed to be responsible for multiple high-profile ransomware attacks since 2018. The group has attacked victims in various sectors and locations, including multiple attacks on healthcare entities. An October 2021 Mandiant assessment indicated 85% of the group's victims were U.S.-based, and the large majority of them were large enterprises with more than $300 million in annual revenue. The report also assessed that initial access brokers partnering with FIN12 target a wider range of organizations and allow FIN12 actors to select victims for further malicious activity.<sup>[[Mandiant FIN12 Group Profile October 07 2021](/references/7af84b3d-bbd6-449f-b29b-2f14591c9f05)]</sup>\n\nFIN12's toolset has reportedly shifted over time. Cobalt Strike has been observed in most intrusions. While TrickBot and Empire were common post-exploitation tools historically, French authorities observed the group using SystemBC alongside Cobalt Strike during a March 2023 hospital center intrusion. Ryuk, and to a lesser degree Conti, were traditionally used ransomware payloads, with the former used in a series of attacks on U.S. healthcare entities in 2020. However, a French CERT assessment published in 2023 linked the group to multiple more recent incidents it investigated and analyzed, which featured deployment of various ransomware families, including Hive, Nokoyawa, Play, Royal, and BlackCat, along with Emotet and BazarLoader malware for initial footholds.<sup>[[Mandiant FIN12 Group Profile October 07 2021](/references/7af84b3d-bbd6-449f-b29b-2f14591c9f05)]</sup><sup>[[CERTFR-2023-CTI-007](/references/0f4a03c5-79b3-418e-a77d-305d5a32caca)]</sup>\n\n**Related Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2023-21746, CVE-2022-24521, CVE-2021-34527, CVE-2019-0708, CVE-2020-1472<sup>[[CERTFR-2023-CTI-007](/references/0f4a03c5-79b3-418e-a77d-305d5a32caca)]</sup>",

      "description": "Killnet is an apparent hacktivist collective that has primarily used distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in support of its ideology, which appears to largely align with Russian state interests. The group emerged in October 2021, initially offering DDoS capabilities as a for-hire service. However, after the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Killnet explicitly pledged allegiance to Russia and began to threaten and claim responsibility for attacks on targets in Ukraine and in countries perceived to support Ukraine. To date, the group has claimed and is believed to be responsible for a considerable number of DDoS attacks on government and private sector targets in a range of sectors, using a variety of discrete techniques to carry them out. It is also believed to be behind a smaller number of data exfiltration-focused attacks, and it has promoted the use of defacement tools in its communication channels with supporters.<sup>[[Flashpoint Glossary Killnet](/references/502cc03b-350b-4e2d-9436-364c43a0a203)]</sup>\n\nIn October 2023, following a series of air- and land-based attacks in the Gaza Strip, researchers observed Killnet claiming responsibility for disruptive attacks against computer networks in Israel and pledging explicit support for Palestinian interests.<sup>[[RyanW3stman Tweet October 10 2023](/references/cfd0ad64-54b2-446f-9624-9c90a9a94f52)]</sup>",

      "description": "This object represents the LockBit Ransomware-as-a-Service (\"RaaS\") apex group and the behaviors associated with its various affiliate ransomware operators. Specific affiliate operations defined by the research community will be tracked as separate objects.\n\nRansomware labeled \"LockBit\" was first observed in 2020. LockBit developers have introduced multiple versions of the LockBit encryption tool. According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (\"CISA\"), the following major LockBit variants have been observed (first-observed dates in parentheses): ABCD (LockBit malware's predecessor; September 2019), LockBit (January 2020), LockBit 2.0 (June 2021), LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker (October 2021), LockBit 3.0 (March 2022), LockBit Green (a variant that incorporates source code from Conti ransomware; January 2023), and variants capable of targeting macOS environments (April 2023). As of June 2023, CISA reported that the web panel that offers affiliates access to LockBit malware explicitly listed the LockBit 2.0, LockBit 3.0, LockBit Green, and LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker variants.<sup>[[U.S. CISA Understanding LockBit June 2023](/references/9c03b801-2ebe-4c7b-aa29-1b7a3625964a)]</sup>\n\nSince emerging in 2020, the LockBit group and its affiliates have carried out a very large number of attacks involving a wide range of victims around the world. In June 2023, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation reported it had identified 1,700 LockBit attacks since 2020.<sup>[[U.S. CISA Understanding LockBit June 2023](/references/9c03b801-2ebe-4c7b-aa29-1b7a3625964a)]</sup> According to data collected by the [ransomwatch project](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch) and analyzed by Tidal, LockBit actors publicly claimed 970 victims in 2022 (576 associated with the LockBit 2.0 variant and 394 associated with LockBit 3.0), the most of any extortion threat that year. Through April 2023, LockBit had claimed 406 victims, more than double the number of the next threat (Clop, with 179 victims).<sup>[[GitHub ransomwatch](/references/62037959-58e4-475a-bb91-ff360d20c1d7)]</sup> CISA reported in June 2023 that U.S. ransoms paid to LockBit since January 2020 totaled $91 million.<sup>[[U.S. CISA Understanding LockBit June 2023](/references/9c03b801-2ebe-4c7b-aa29-1b7a3625964a)]</sup>\n\nLockBit affiliate operators are known to use a wide variety of techniques during their attacks. Initial access for LockBit infections has occurred via most methods (including a number of vulnerability exploits), and operators are known to abuse a range of free and open-source software tools for a variety of post-exploitation activities. In addition to victim data encryption, LockBit actors routinely exfiltrate victim data and threaten to leak this data for extortion purposes.\n\n**Related Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2021-22986, CVE-2023-0669, CVE-2023-27350, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-22986, CVE-2020-1472, CVE-2019-0708, CVE-2018-13379<sup>[[U.S. CISA Understanding LockBit June 2023](/references/9c03b801-2ebe-4c7b-aa29-1b7a3625964a)]</sup>",

The group has targeted a variety of sectors, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications. It appears the group carries out supply chain attacks, leveraging the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets. The group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.<sup>[[FireEye APT34 Dec 2017](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/88f41728-08ad-4cd8-a418-895738d68b04)]</sup><sup>[[Palo Alto OilRig April 2017](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/fb561cdd-03f6-4867-b5b5-7e4deb11f0d0)]</sup><sup>[[ClearSky OilRig Jan 2017](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/f19f9ad4-bb31-443b-9c26-87946469a0c3)]</sup><sup>[[Palo Alto OilRig May 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/53836b95-a30a-4e95-8e19-e2bb2f18c738)]</sup><sup>[[Palo Alto OilRig Oct 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/14bbb07b-caeb-4d17-8e54-047322a5930c)]</sup><sup>[[Unit42 OilRig Playbook 2023](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/e38902bb-9bab-5beb-817b-668a67a76541)]</sup><sup>[[Unit 42 QUADAGENT July 2018](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/320f49df-7b0a-4a6a-8542-17b0f56c94c9)]</sup>",

Its activities primarily focus on espionage and information gathering. Researchers indicate the group is focused on maintaining stealth and persistence in victim networks for as long as possible, leveraging a large number of living-off-the-land techniques to accomplish these goals. Researchers assessed with moderate confidence that Volt Typhoon's activities are focused on developing capabilities that could disrupt communications infrastructure between the United States and entities in Asia in the event of a potential geopolitical crisis.<sup>[[U.S. CISA Volt Typhoon May 24 2023](/references/12320f38-ebbf-486a-a450-8a548c3722d6)]</sup>\n\n**Related Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2021-40539, CVE-2021-27860<sup>[[U.S. CISA Volt Typhoon May 24 2023](/references/12320f38-ebbf-486a-a450-8a548c3722d6)]</sup>",
