When first discovered in 2014 it was one of the most sophisticated Android remote administration tools known at that time. It was one of the first Trojan applications to get past Google's Bouncer and caused researchers to warn about it being easier to create Android malware due to it. It also seems to have follow in the footsteps of Zeus and SpyEye by having simple-to-use command and control panels. The code appeared to be leaked somewhere around 2014.

The client, an international retail organization, attempted to download and run what appeared to be a regular update. The computer trying to download this update was a back office system that processed end of day credit card transactions. This system also had the capability of connecting to the corporate network which contained company sales reports.\nDigiTrust experts were alerted to something malicious and blocked the download. The investigation found that what appeared to be an Adobe Flash Player update, was a Remote Access Trojan called NanoCore. If installation had been successful, customer credit card data, personal information, and internal sales information could have been captured and monetized. During the analysis of NanoCore, our experts found that there was much more to this RAT than simply being another Remote Access Trojan.",

Mangit was allegedly developed by  \"Ric\", a Brazilian hacker, who makes himself available via Skype to discuss rental agreements. Once the malware is rented or purchased, the user controls a portion of the Mangit botnet, the trojan, the dropper, an auto-update system, and the server infrastructure to run their attacks. Mangit contains support for nine Brazillian banks including Citibank, HSBC, and Santander. The malware can also be used to steal user PayPal credentials. Mangit has the capability to collect banking credentials, receive SMS texts when a victim is accessing their bank account, and take over victim's browsers. To circumvent two-factor authentication, attackers can use Mangit to lock victim's browsers and push pop-ups to the victim asking for the verification code they just received.",

      "description": "ROKRAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) that leverages a malicious Hangual Word Processor (HWP) document sent in spearphishing emails to infect hosts. The HWP document contains an embedded Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) object. The object exploits an EPS buffer overflow vulnerability and downloads a binary disguised as a .JPG file. The file is then decoded and the ROKRAT executable is initiated. The trojan uses legitimate Twitter, Yandex, and Mediafire websites for its command and control communications and exfiltration platforms, making them difficult to block globally. Additionally, the platforms use HTTPS connections, making it more difficult to gather additional data on its activities. Cisco's Talos Group identified two email campaigns. In one, attackers send potential victims emails from an email server of a private university in Seoul, South Korea with a sender email address of \"kgf2016@yonsei.ac.kr,\" the contact email for the Korea Global Forum, adding a sense of legitimacy to the email. It is likely that the email address was compromised and used by the attackers in this campaign. The second is less sophisticated and sends emails claiming to be from a free Korean mail service with a the subject line, \"Request Help\" and attached malicious HWP filename, \"I'm a munchon person in Gangwon-do, North Korea.\" The ROKRAT developer uses several techniques to hinder analysis, including identifying tools usually used by malware analysts or within sandbox environments. Once it has infected a device, this trojan can execute commands, move a file, remove a file, kill a process, download and execute a file, upload documents, capture screenshots, and log keystrokes. Researchers believe the developer is a native Korean speaker and the campaign is currently targeting Korean-speakers.",

      "description": "On November 8, 2016 a non-disclosed entity in Laos was spear-phished by a group closely related to known Chinese adversaries and most likely affiliated with the Chinese government. The attackers utilized a new kind of Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that has not been previously observed or reported. The new RAT extends the capabilities of traditional RATs by providing complete remote execution of custom commands and programming. htpRAT, uncovered by RiskIQ cyber investigators, is the newest weapon in the Chinese adversary’s arsenal in a campaign against Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Most RATs can log keystrokes, take screenshots, record audio and video from a webcam or microphone, install and uninstall programs and manage files. They support a fixed set of commands operators can execute using different command IDs —’file download’ or ‘file upload,’ for example—and must be completely rebuilt to have different functionality. htpRAT, on the other hand, serves as a conduit for operators to do their job with greater precision and effect. On the Command and Control (C2) server side, threat actors can build new functionality in commands, which can be sent to the malware to execute. This capability makes htpRAT a small, agile, and incredibly dynamic piece of malware. Operators can change functionality, such as searching for a different file on the victim’s network, simply by wrapping commands. ",

The second, in July, targeted Tibetan dissidents.

This RAT, which PACT refers to by its internal codename “DarkWatchman”, has been observed being distributed by email and represents an evolution in fileless malware techniques, as it uses the registry for nearly all temporary and permanent storage and therefore never writes anything to disk, allowing it to operate beneath or around the detection threshold of most security tools.  PACT has reverse engineered the DGA, dynamically analyzed the malware, investigated the Threat Actor’s (TA) web-based infrastructure, and consolidated the results of our analysis into the following report.",

      "description": "STRRAT is a Java-based RAT with a JavaScript wrapper/dropper that was discovered in 2020. Its core payload (a .JAR file) is contained under several layers of obfuscation and encoding inside the JavaScript wrapper/dropper.\n\nSTRRAT is propagated by malicious email attachments. Its capabilities include standard RAT functionalities (remote access, remote command execution), browser and email-client credential harvesting, and a unique ransomware-like functionality – if instructed, it will add a “.crimson” extension to files on the device, rendering them inoperable (though they can be easily recovered because their content is not modified).\n\nUnlike many Java-based malware, STRRAT does not require Java to be installed on the infected system in order to operate. When the JavaScript wrapper/dropper is executed, if a suitable Java runtime installation is not found, one will be downloaded and installed in order to assure the contained Java payload can execute.",

      "description": "Chinese FortiGate RAT. The COATHANGER malware is a remote access trojan (RAT) designed specifically for Fortigate appliances. It is used as second-stage malware, and does not exploit a new vulnerability. Intelligence services MIVD & AIVD refer to the malware as COATHANGER based on a string present in the code./nThe COATHANGER malware is stealthy and persistent. It hides itself by hooking system calls that could reveal its presence. It survives reboots and firmware upgrades./nMIVD & AIVD assess with high confidence that the malicious activity was conducted by a state-sponsored actor from the People’s Republic of China. This is part of a wider trend of Chinese political espionage against the Netherlands and its allies./nMIVD & AIVD assess that use of COATHANGER may be relatively targeted. The Chinese threat actor(s) scan for vulnerable edge devices at scale and gain access opportunistically, and likely introduce COATHANGER as a communication channel for select victims.",
