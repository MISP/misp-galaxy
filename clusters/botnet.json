First identified in July 2007 when it was used to steal information from the United States Department of Transportation, it became more widespread in March 2009. In June 2009 security company Prevx discovered that Zeus had compromised over 74,000 FTP accounts on websites of such companies as the Bank of America, NASA, Monster.com, ABC, Oracle, Play.com, Cisco, Amazon, and BusinessWeek. Similarly to Koobface, Zeus has also been used to trick victims of tech support scams into giving the scam artists money through pop-up messages that claim the user has a virus, when in reality they might have no viruses at all.

Muhstik operators are using these three payloads to make money via the infected hosts.",

Until today, equipment owners could always remove IoT malware from their smart devices, modems, and routers by resetting the device.\nThe reset operation flushed the device's flash memory, where the device would keep all its working data, including IoT malware strains.\nBut today, Bitdefender researchers announced they found an IoT malware strain that under certain circumstances copies itself to /etc/init.d/, a folder that houses daemon scripts on Linux-based operating systems —like the ones on routers and IoT devices.\nBy placing itself in this menu, the device's OS will automatically start the malware's process after the next reboot.",
